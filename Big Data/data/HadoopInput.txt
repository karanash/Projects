THE HORRORS OF BOKHARA
Terrible Deed That One Mad Place
Byword Are Now Pro
hibited. Tlie terrible doeds that once made .,
Bokhara a byword are now prohibit
sd by the Russian government. Pris
Dners are not permitted, for instance,
to be dragged through the streets by
galloping horses! Xor are they
thrown from the top of the high
tower called the Minar Katan. This
was the usual punishment meted out
to evil-doers in the old days. Watched
by thousands of spectators, the poor
wretches were flung from that giddy
height on to the flagstones beneath.
Bokhara has many chambers of
horrors, unwholesome for western
eyes to see, -and the description of
which would certainly be unflt for -publication.
Perhaps the most hor
rible of these Is a pit where prison
ers were tortured by vermin, which
were so numerous and ravenous that
in the absence of human prey they
were fed on chunks of raw meat.
From Wide World Magazine.
HIS IDEA.
era
His Father (after punishing him) .
It hurt me more to whip you
than it did you.
Tommy Then all I've got to say
is that you can stand an awful lot
of punishment without hollering.
ONLY ONE OF IT8 KIND.
"The children should know and
remember what their fathers have ac
complished," said a native to a
Frcnchmau as they stood before a
monument which had just been
erected in the East park, at Tokyo.
The monument is probably the only
one of its kind. It is one of the
monster siege guns captured by the
Japanese from the Russians in the
war with that country, and it haa
been erected complete, with every de
tail restored. Writing about the me
morial, the visitor says : "It made
deep impression on me, this grim in
strument of war in the midst of a
peaceful scene; and if the smiling
young people who stood about it saw
as I did, they read in the lines of
tube and mechanism the American
injunction: 'Keep your powder
dry.' "
BATTLE OF AGINCOURT.
Agincourt, from which Henry V.
made his triumphal entry into Lon
don, is our English way of spelling
Azincourt, just as Blenheim is a sim
ilar corruption of Blindheim. In
about 2lv hours Henry's little army
slew 10,000 Frenchmen, nearly twice
as many as we ourselves lost out
right in battle during our Boer war,
lasting over 2!2 years and yet we
talk complacently of our "modern
arms of precision!" A monument
at Agincourt marks the cemetery of
the slain. Few battlefields hare
changed their appearance so little.
The field may be reached within a
railway hour from Boulogne, but few
tourists go to the scene of the most
wonderful feat of arms achieved by
our race. London Chronicle.

Santa Fe Will
Build Cutoff
Dodge City-Colmor Line Will
Save Seyehty-One Miles
in Distance.
From The Denver Post.
Las Vegas, N. M. Feb. 20. It
was learned here today from an
authorative source that the Santa
Ferhas begun the purchase of a
right-of-way for fts Dodge Uity
Colmor cutoff. The proposed cut
off will run in. almost an air line
from Dodge City, Kansas, to Col
mor, N. M., and will reduce the
distance now traversed by the
road's main , line between the two
poines seventy-one miles, besides
avoiding the steep' Katon moun
tain grade and tunnel. It will
open up a new territory for the
output of coal mines along the
Santa Fe.
This cutoff likely will be the" first
section of the Santa Fe's new
road shortening improvements to
be built. The second will be the
Sulzbacher-Vaughn cutoff, a dis
tance of 100 miles, which will form
a connecting link in the Santa Fe's
Gal yeston-to-Denver line. Surveys
for both cutoffs were completed
late last fall.

The Surest Dry Land Grain.
Milo is the surest yielding grain
crop that is grown in Eastern Col
orado, Western Kansas and Okla
homa, the Panhandle of Texas and
Eastern New Mexico.
The U, S. Department of Agri
culture reports the average yield
for five years at Amarillo, Texas,
and other dry land experiment
stations at 40 bushels of grain per
acre a year. Farmers in the same
section report yields of from thir
ty to eighty bushels per acre.
A bushel of milo will produce
from ten to. eleven - pounds of
pork. This makes the average an
nual pork production from the dry
lands of the southwest equal to
400 and upwards pounds of pork
per acre where milo is grown and
fed. Ten pounds of milo have the
same feeding value for horses,
beef and dairy cattle, hogs and
sheep as nine pounds of corn.
- Milo is the corn tor the plains
of the Southwest and should be
grown instead of corn where the
annual rainfall drops below twenty-five
inches. Farmers in the
Panhandle of Texas say that it
never fails to yield a crop of grain,
and that it will yield twenty bush
els an acre in years so dry that
wheat is an absolute failure. Milo
should have the same place in dry
land farming that corn has in Iowa
and Illinois. It has nearly the
same composition as corn, like
feeding qualities, and can be used
with protiit for the feeding of ev
ery class of farm animals to which
com is fed.
: Every farmer in this section
this year should plant and thor
oughly cultivate at least 40 acres
of milo. It will insure his pros
perity and the prosperity of the
entire community. Milo, well cul
tivated, is a sure crop and a large
acreage means well fed teams, and
plenty of grain to fatten steers
and hogs and to feed dairy cows.

Nickel Plate. He says, "Twenty
years of railroading left my kid
neys in terrible condition. There
was a continual pain across my
back and hips and my kidneys
gave me much distress, and the
action of my bladder was frequent
and most painful. I got a supply
of Foley Kidney Pills and the first
bottle made a wonderful improve
ment, and four bottles cured me
completely. Since being cured I
have recommended Foley Kidney
Pills to many of my railroad
friends.

Mrs. Miller, who lives In District
22. made us a pleasant visit the first
part of the week. She is holding
down the claim while her husband
works in the city. Her son George
''keeps bach" with papa and goes to
school in Liberal. Mrs. Miller is an
ex-shool teacher and Is very mucli in
terested in the education of her chil
dren. Prof. Wilson from Newton, Kansas,
formerly from Cadez, 111., made us a
pleasant call. He Is following Horace
Greeley's aoylce, "Go West Young
Man." He thinks of locating out
here in the southwest corner of Kan
sas and may become one of Seward
County's corps of teachers. He holds
a professional certificate and has had
experience In school work.
Misses Lottie Ilenline, Florence
McGregor, Vivia Jones, Gertrude
AndJewsand Messers Fuller, Light
and Green met at Kismet, March 4th
and had a very enjoyable and profita
ble teachers' meeting. They met In
the Kismet school house. All took
part In the discussion and every one
was prepared with his or her part.
We are sorry the other teachers In
Fargo Township were not present.
The teachers in the southern part of
i Fargo attend the meetings In Liberal
as it Is more convenient. A teacher
ought to attend every educational
meeting in her district and county
and state that site possibly can. The
school boards should gently remind
their teachers of this.
Frank Swlnk writes us that they
met March 4th and had a very Inter
esting meeting in Seward Township.
The teachers enjoy "The School And
Its Life" better than elements of ag
rlculture. Mr. Swlnk writes "I find
The School and Its Life' says Just
what I have been thinking for the
last several years but did not hnow
how to say it."
The teachers of Liberal Township
met at the court house In the office
of the County Superintendent. . We
had a very good meeting with nearly
twenty in attendance counting visi
tors. Excellent discussions were giv
en on all chapters.
We expect to hold a union meeting
of all the townships on the morning
of April 1st at the court house, be
ginning at nine o'clock. We will dis
cuss the remaining chapters of "The
School And Its Life" and. chapters
ten to sixteen and seventeen in "Ele
ments of Agreculture. - Miss Lottie
Henline will discuss chapter sixteen,
"The Farm Home," Frank Swlnk,
chapter seventeen, "Farm Manage
ment," Prof. Fulton, chapter ten,
"Feeds and Feeding" in "Elements of
Agriculture. Prof. Rindom will re
view the chapter in "The School And
Its Life" on Judging Results In
Teaching. Miss Florence McGregor,
The Superintendent, Miss Alice
Smith, the Principal, the County
Superlntendant, Home and School.
We think these books will meet in
July and where we hope to meet all
the teachers of Seward County for
the next school year. !
The spelling contest will be April
1st at 2:30 at City Hall. The contest
is to see who will represent the dis
trict at the county contest which will
be held Monday, March 27. The
teacher will ask some one or two or
more patrons of the district to come
and help on that day. This prelimi
nary contest should be written. We
will omit rules and suffixes and pre
fixes this year. Be sure to select the
difficult words. Have your pupils
trained to write legibly so that there
will be no doubt what a letter Is. Pu
pils In grades five and six will spell in
part two. Pupils in grades 7, 8 and 9
will spell In part three.

The row on the streets of the
town last Saturday is a monument
to the incompetency of the city
marshall. There could have been
nothing added to make it more
unpleasant. A city officer, of
course, should have the support
of the citizens of the town, but it
seems out of the question to get
people to support a man who has
so few of the qualifications for the
job as our present marshall. We
wonder just how much longer we
will be compelled to put up with
that kind of an officer.
, A pleasant change in the issue
before the people at the next city
election will be the elimination of
the old time question of wet and
drv. and bootlegger and anti-boot
legger. The men on both tickets
will go in on a ticket of law en
forcement, so the only question
which should be taken into con
sideration is the business ability
nf tha men on the two tickets. It
is probable that the next counci
will have about the same amount
of money as the 'present council.
Every voter should express his
preference at the polls on April 3.
We believe in the rule of the ma

The Citizens have issued a plat
form. The Progressives have not
stated their position on the issues
before the people.
News, news, news, it's enough
to give a man the blues. Nobody
married, nobody dead, nobody
lost an arm or head . Nobody came
in to talk of the "cap", no one got
boosy and started a scrap, nobody
run in for taking a horn, nobody
burried and nobody born. Oh,
for a racket, a riot, a fuss. Some'
one come in and kick up a muss,
something to stir up the peace laden
air, somebody's comet to give us
a scare. Someone to come in and
pay up his dues, anything, any
thine, iust so its news. Fredonia

Because Stubbs vetoed the Orr
bill fixing the salaries in the At
torney General's office, cutting
out all fees, John Dawson has giv
en out a few suggestions to the
public.
1 wish that the newspapers
would tell the public," said Daw
son, "that I was heartily in favor
of this bill which passed the legis-
ature. You can say also that the
lawvers who advised the governor
that the bill would wipe out the
authority of the attorney general
to appoint assistant attorneys gen
eral to enforce the prohibitory
law, or affect their compensation
. l
in any way, is the prize ass ana
his ears would over-top the flag
staff on the court house dome."
It happens that it was the ad
vise of former Att. Gen. Fred S.
Jackson that led the governor to
veto the bill and to hold that it
would reneal the present statutes
permitting the attorney general to
appoint assistants to enforce the
prohibitory law.

A Hospital Planned.
A movement is now on foot for
a hospital for Liberal. It has of
ten been pointed out that the town
has numerous churches and lodges
who are active in improving con
ditions of life, but it has no insti
tution for the saving of life. A
plan was tried out here about a
year ago to secure a hospital by
stock subscription. The idea now
is to sell tickets which will be
transferrable, and which will en
title the holder of the ticket to
hospital care for one week, at any
time within two years after the
hospital is completed . The patient
may select his own physician, and
will also nay the doctor's bill. Al
registered physicians will have ac
cess to the hospital. About 150
tickets have been sold to the busi
ness men and citizens of the town
and very little canvassing has been
done up to date. It is estimated
by the promoters of the hospita
that they will need to sell 400 tick
ets to insure the success of the
project. The plan is to build
hospital which will cost not oyer
$10,000. A loan will be made to
cover the balance ot the cost. It
is said that a lone has been assured
bv an eastern party. It seems
that the promoters will have littl
or no trouble in raising the amount
needed. It is indeed trivial as
compared to the amount that is
spent annually or even semi-annual
ly in Liberal for tobacco and other
trifles. If the people can be con
vinced that we need a hospital
here, there is little question ' but
that we will tave it.
Death of Mrs. J. E. Thompson
.. Lydla Alice, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. M. J. Boyce: was born October
7th, 1884 and died at the home of her
mother, 314 South- Michigan Street,
Plymouth, Inda., at the age of 26
years and 5 mouths.
In September 1907 she was married
to James Edward Thompson, and
their went to Liberal, Kansas, only to
spend a brief but happy married life
before the husband was taken away
in Julv 1909. . This loss was felt by
Mrs. Thompson so deeply that she
had no further desire to live and fre:
quently talked of Joining her hus
band where there would be no more
parting.
She was converted and joined the
M. E. church at Gilead when young
and proved herself a faithrui ana er
flcent worker in the church and Sun
day School.
She was a kind and loving daugh
ter and sister. She patiently endured
great suffering during her illness until
death came to her relief.
The deceased leaves a mother, flve
sisters, three brothers and many
friends to mourn her loss.
The funeral was held at Richland
Center, Inda., Thursday, March 9th,
at 11:30 a.m.
Don't Quit.
Flirht and the crowd stays with you:
Onit. and vou're out of the race;
For he who quits goes down and out,
And he who fights slips into bis place.
Dig, and you reach rock-bottom;
Outt. aud rou'll find but sand.
For the treasure Is for the dlgger-
For the quitter, the rifled laud.
Plow, and you turn smooth furrows:
Quit, and your tools gather rust;
Boot, and you soon learn to burrow;
Keep Striving, and pay you It must.
The world lays Its coin on the winner;
For the shirk, it has no use at all;
So, up with yon; Wrestle, you sinner!
Or don't howl If you go to the wall.

Notice
Complaint has been made to me
by several residents of the north
west part of the city that the land
adjoining and laying just west of
the Frisco and Summers addition
to the city of Liberal is being
used as a public dumping ground
and that the same is becoming
public nuisance. Action will be
taken against anyone dumping re
fuse on this ground or near there
in the future.
1 would suggest that those who
haye been using this ground secure
the consent of someone owning
land farther from the city, then no
one will be injured.

The Contrary Mule
A farmer in Kentucky sought
advice from a veterinary about a
sick mule. The doctor advised
calomel, five times the dose for a
man.
'"How can I make him take it?"
"You put a stick of wood three
Quarters of an inch thick between
his teeth, and then you take this
rubber tube, put in the calomel m
it, insert in the mule's mouth,
which is held open by the piece of
of wood, and blow the medicine
down his throat."
"That's easy enough," said the
farmer.
Three weeks later the doctor
met the farmer, who had changed
greatly. He was emaciated,
humped, ghastly and bundled in
heavy wrappings.
Why, what's the. matter '
said the doctor.
The farmer sighed deeply and
spoke feebly. "That mule", he
said, "that cussed, idiotic, fool
mulel You see, I got ready just
as you told me, got the tube in
his mouth ready to blow, and
then," he paused for breath, "then
that infernal mule blew nrst."

We write much of mother and tell
how we love her.
We offer our hearts at her shrine,
We praise her ornately (she take it
sedately!)
Hereafter it's father for mine.
Of course I'll admit, she deserves
auite a bit
Of love and affection no doubt:
I always. have said It, she gets all
the credit,
But father's most always left out
Who does all the plugging while maw
gets the hugging,
Who toils In srood weather and bad?
Whose arms bear the burden, who
scarce gets a word in?
You bet vour sweet life it is Dad.
How long has he waited ror praises

Let's make his poor starved heart feel

And while we're about it, let's stand

A Farewell Party
A farewell party was given, at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. J. N. Hllde-
brand on Collee Hill, Manhattan,
Kansas, March Kith, by their daugh
ter, Miss Mae, and Miss Wartenbee.
The Kuest of honor was Mr. Thos.A.
Low of Liberal, who has completed
the Dairy Short Course at K. S. A. C.
and has accepted a position as chief
salesman for a creamery company at
Emporia. "
The evening .was spent In games,
instrumental musle and singing. Mr.
Hildebrand favored the guests with
several violin selections. The most
amusing game was the boy's contest
In Domestic Art in which they were
given needle and thread and other
material and required to dress a
clothes pin In imitation of a hobble
skirt. Mr. Low carried off the prize
for having made the best hobble
skirt.
Later in the evening the boys pro
ceeded to unwind a tedious spider
web at the end of which they found
the name of the lady they were to
take to luncheon.
A two course luncheon was served.
The place cards were decorated with
a shamrock leaf which was symbolic
of St Patrick's day.
At a late hour the gue'.ls departed
wishing Mr. Low success In his new
position, and declaring that Mr. and
Mrs. Hildebrand were royal entertain
ers. A Friend.

Miscellaneous Shower
A number of the friends of Miss
Mary Williams gathered at the
home of Mrs. I. Calvert on Third
street Friday evening and awaited
Miss Mary's coming. When she
entered the house they surprised
her with a shower of miscellaneous
articles along with expressions of
appreciation and well wishes.
Games and social conversation
detained the guests until a late
hour. Ice cream and cake were
served! The guest of honor very
graciously thanked her friends for
the pleasure of the occasion 'and
the tifts which they had bestowed
upon her. She has been employed
in the Boles store for the past two
years and many are the friends
and lodge people who, like her
employers, regret to see her go
away. Miss Williams left, Sun
day, for Hutchinson where she
will visit friends before going to
her home at Perry, Okla. While
can only guess as to what occupa
tion Miss Williams expects to take
up, it appears that her intimate
friends thought she might find
linens, china and other household
dainties valuable.

What did you think of our millinery
opening last Saturday? No doubt you
came. It looked as if everybody came
judging from the crowd. It was by far
the greatest success in the history of
this department The 400 large carna
tions and the 10 gallons of punch were
exhausted long before the afternoon was
well advanced, and many visitors' were
unable to get to the millinery depart
ment owing to the immense crowd.
The fact that our sales were almost
double what they were a year ago
shows the increasing popularity of this
department

Dear Teacher:- LibmI' KS March 19' 1911
I wish to call your attention to & number of important matters at this time. Please read
carefully and make announcements in your school at once.
Spelling Contest
The second annual spelling contest will be held in Liberal, April 1st at 2:30 p. m., in the city hall
At that time the district representatives from the different school districts will contest for first place
We hope to make this meeting one of great interest to pupils, teachers and patrons and cordially invite
all those who are interested in the school work of our county to be present. The two dry goods stores of
Liberal. The Economy and Chas. Summers & Sons have kindly offered some prizes which will add en
thusiasm to those participating.
Rules for Spelling First This contest is only for pupils from the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth
and ninth grades of the Seward County schools. Second The contest will be entirely oral and consist of
the spelling of words found in the following lessons: Lessons 131-250 inclusive in part two and lessons 150
212 inclusive in part three. Third The school or district contest will be held in each school March 27 at
such hours as the teacher may elect and will determine the ones who shall represent the school in the
county contest. Fourth In the school contest those in charge will have all contestants stand in line and
spell. Every pupil in the above mentioned grades should contest without fail. But one trial will be
given each pupil on a word. When a pupil has missed three words he shall be seated. Continue in this
way until the contest is decided. The pronouncer will give the difihitions of all homonyms. Capital
letters and hyphens need not be given. All words will be pronounced once distinctly and more if it is
thought the pupil does not understand the pronuncntion. In that case ask the pupil to pronounce the
word and then spell it. The persons in charge will allow a reasonable time for the pupil to sp ell the
word but reserves the right to pass the word to the next if the speller is so slow that it indicates that he
can not spell the word. Each school may send to the county contest the two best spellers in part two and
the two best spellers in part three.
Spelling Awards
1 The two highest in the county contest in part two will be given cash prizes as follows: First place
$3.00; second, $2.00. The two highest in part three will be given, first place $3.00; second place $2.00.
These are the prizes donated by the Economy and Chas. Summers & Sous dry goods store.
It will be remembered that last year the commercial club of Liberal donated the banners which are
now held by districts 24 and 4. We wonder what districts will hold them the coming year.
2 The ten highest in the county contest in part three will be given full credit in the'eommon school
diploma examination this year with grades as follows: 100 per cent, 99 per cent, 98 per cent. 97 per cent
tc, etc.
, 3 All pupils in part three winning in the district contest and representing their school at the county
contest will be given half credit on the spelling examination for common school diploma this year. Ke
member they must attend the county contest. The names of all school or district winners will be pub
lished intho papers of the county.

"There's so much good In the worst
of us, and there's so much bad in the
best of us, that It doesn't behoove any
of us to speak 111 of the rest of us.'
Last week, a local newspaper
devoted considerable space to a con
demnation of the Guymon Herald
because it was advocating a com
pany of the state militia for that
city. The local editor said: "It
is'nt the gospel Christ taught us.
It is not the way to promote 'peace
on earth and good will to men.' "
It further says that the Herald is
in this instance (in advocating a
local company of militia) a mouth
piece of the devil and an able
expounder of the doctrines of
hell. In another column, in the
same paper, the editor says "the
mashall of this town should be
provided with a spiked club and a
gatling gun." We fail to see why
the invective he threw at the
Herald does'nt apply pretty well
to his own case.
The city scales proposition will
probably be decided at one of the
very early meetings of the new
council. If you have not already
done so, send us a card today, say
ing you are in favor of it. This
is one part of the city government
that is of great interest to the sur
rounding country, and we ought

cil to number the houses and place
markers at the street corners did
"hot meet with any great amount of
criticism, but the little 4x4 posts
6 or 7 feet high that they "are put
ting up around town are consider
able of a joke to most everybody
except those who are paying for
them.
If a few of us who live in this
country do not exert ourselves to
make this a better place to live,
pray tell us who will?

A newspaper subscriber once re
ceived a dun through the postof
tice and it made him mad. He
went to see the editor about it,
and the editor showed him a few
duns of his own one for type,
one for paper, one for fuel and
several others. "Now," said the
editor, "I didn't get mad when I
got these because I knew that all
I had to do was to ask several re
liable gentlemen like you to come
in and help me out, and then I
could settle them all". When the
subscriber saw how it was he re
lented, paid up and renewed for
another year.

dangerous kidney and bladder
trouble resulting from years of
railroading. Geo. E. Bell, of C39
Third St., Fort Wayne, Ind., was
many years a conductor on the
Nickel Plate. He says, Iwenty
years of railroading left my kid
neys in terrible condition. J. here
was a continual pain across my
back and hips and my kidneys
gave me much distress, and the
action of my bladder was frequent
and most painful. I got a supply
of Foley Kidney Puis and the hrst
bottle made a wonderful improve-1
ment, and four bottles cured me
completely. Since being cured
have recommended Uoley Kidney
Pills to many of my railroad
friends.

Mam-Here's the Reason
Do you see that little white line
at the arrow tip-that' s the taping
that should be put into a garment
if you expect it to hold its shape.
Wool material, whether cut
straight or on the bias, will stretch
unless properly supported the
slightest stretching makes surplus
material. This surplus will
change the straight pretty lines of
a lapel or a coat front into a series
of puckers and curves, thus spoil
ing the entire fit and shape of
your garment.

I . UNKNOWN LABRADOR.
Labrador ii an unknown region to
most people, but a glance at the map
will show that it it a vast peninsula,
with a total area of 500,000 square
miles, lying north of Belle Isle
strait and embraced in the north
""temperate zone, the southern section
lying along the same parallels as the
great wheat" growing areas of west
ern Canada. Newfoundland owns
and administers the eastern section
of Labrador, fronting on the Atlan
tic, and expeditions have explored it
for some years past, but, naturally
only superficially, because its im
mensity of area is such as to preclude
a detailed investigation. The official
reports, however, show that the coun
try is splendidly wooded, and that in
Hamilton inlet, Sandwich bay, and
other districts on the east coast
there Is splendid timber and some of
the greatest water powers in the
world, while the region, being open
to navigation for seven months of
the year, possesses the same advan
tages for the pulp and paper indus
try as the mills in those parts of
northern Europe which supply Eu
ropean centers today.
IN TWO VOLUMES.
There is an amusing anecdote
about King Louis of Bavaria in
Lady Dorothy Nevill's reminis
cences: "Resolving to relieve the
needs of one of his poor but brave
aids-de-camp, he sent him a small
portfolio, bound like a book, in
which were deposited 600 crowns.
Some time afterward he met the of
ficer and said to him, 'Ah, well, how
did you like the new work which I
lent you ?' 'Excessively, sire replied
the colonel. 'I read it with such in
terest that I expect the second vol
ume with impatience.' The king
' smiled, and when tils' officer's birth
day arrived, he presented him with
another portfolio, similar in every
respect, to the first, but with these
words engraved upon it: 'This book
is complete in two voluniea.' "
COMING EVENTS.
There is the - story of the young
American heiress just arrived in
Paris who was walking through the
Hue de 4a Paix with her father.
They stopped before the show win
dow of a big jeweler's shop to look
at a tiara surmounted by a coronet.
"Fapa, dear," cried the girl, "buy
me that!"
"That, my child? I should like
to, only, you know, to have the right
to wear that jewelry you must be at
least a duchess."
The American girl thought a mo
ment, then replied:
"You buy it 111 find the duke."
REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE.
"I had a most remarkable experi
ence the other day on the road," said
the seasoned traveler.
"It must have been remarkable if
you thought it so. What was it?"
"I met two young men on a Chi
cago limited and they talked to me
20 minutes fully 20 minutes be
fore they told me they were from
New York !" Judge.

twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a Dust Proof Box is to make it right in the . first

oil that bust aitd sand can't get in."
That was well said; So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other Way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box."

The last legislature appropriated
$75,000 to help the weaker districts
in Kansas to have at least a seven
month's term. Any district may
have a longer term if they can afford
it and desire it. We hope that the
districts will vote at least' an eight
month's school so that the pupils
may have a chance to help the weaker
pupils make the required grade. The
pupils that are quick to learn may be
taught drawing, composition and
story writing to keep them busy or
they may be reviewed in their weak
est subject. The children of average
ability will be benefitted by a review
of a month. What the children learn
In a seven month's term depends
largely upon the teacher. As is the
teacher so is the school. The child
will grow and develop and be happy
with a good teacher. It will shrivel
up and hate school under a poor teach
er. HEALTHORASIS FOR SCHOOLS.

The theory of all moral teaching Is
based on two simple principles:
Arousing the feelings so that the
child will pass judgment upon the
moral quality of t-he action and the
determination of the child to put
his decision into the thing that ought
to be done; Tliese two principles
may briefly be expressed thus: judg

by doing.

Voters Have Chance to Say
Who is to be Candidate
Kansas has adopted the Oregon
plan of electing United States
senators. In the closing hours of
the recent session, the house, after
three times defeating this proposi
tion, passed a similar measure that
had gone through the senate by a
majority of two votes.
The bill provides that the candi
dates for United States senator
shall be nominated the same as at
present under the primary election
law. They will still be nominated
at the general election by a major
ity of the legislative districts.
But, in other respects, the law is
materially changed. The voters
may merely instruct or advise the
members of the legislature, who
will, in turn, select the senator.
Under the new Kansas-Oregon
plan law, candidates for represen
tative or state senator may attach
to their petitions or nomination
papers one of two statements re
garding the United States senator
ship. They may declare that they
will be bound by the vote of the
people for United States senator
at the general election or that they
will merely be advised by it
These statements my be filed with
the secretary of state or county
clerk along with the petitions or
nomination papers. The candi
date may select either statement
One of these statements contains
the following provision:
I state to the people of Kan
sas, as well as to the people of
my representative (or senator
ial) district, that during my
term of office I will always
vote for that candidate for
United States senator who has
received the highest number
of the people's votes for that
position at the general elect-'
ion in the state at large next .
preceding the election of the
United States senator, with
out regard Co my individual
preferences or party nomina
tions for that office.
The other contains this provision:
During my term of office I
shall consider the vote of the
people for United States sena
tor at any general election in
the state at large as nothing
more than a recommendation,
which. I shall be at liberty to
wholly disregard if the reason
for so doing seems to me to
be sufficient.
The bill provides that the per
son receiving the highest vote for
United States senator shall be giv
en a certificate by the secretary of
state, reciting that fact and show
ing total number of votes received
at the general election. There is
no penalty provided for the mem
ber of the legislature who violates
his pledge. The bill presumes
that the people will take care of
that matter. In the final test the
standpat republicans and the lead
ers on the democratic side made a
determined fight to beat the bill,
but they could not muster sufficient
votes. The insurgent republican
and the rank and file of the demo
crats declared the people wanted a
trial of the Oregon plan, and they
voted for it.
Many well informed politicans
predict that Kansas will repeat the
recent Oregon experience and that
a democrat may be chosen United
States senator by a republican
legislature. The .prediction is
based on the peculiar political con
ditions in the republican party in
this state. With Senator Curtis a
radical standpatter, and Governor
Stubbs a leading insurgent, both
fighting for the senatorship, it is
believed that State Senator George
11. Hodges, democratic candidate,
will receive the highest vote at the
general election.
If the members are pledged un
der the first statement to cast their
votes for the candidate receiving
the majority or plurality vote of
the people. Hodges would be
chosen senator, for it is conceded
that, with the republican vote di
vided between Stubbs and Curtis,
Hodges the democrat would win.
Another law of far reaching
political effect was passed in the
closing hours of the Kansas legis
lature. The bill prohibits the
publication of unsigned political art
icles in newspapers and no person
is permitted to insert articles
which tend to injure any candidate
for public office. It has been
charged that under the Statewide
primary election law only rich
men or those able to pay for news
paper space, could make a cam
paign for a state office. This bill
is aimed at Governor Stubbs and
others who have used unlimited
space in the daily and local news
papers of the state in the promo
tion of their political interests.

(Successor to The Independent)
The Seward County Publishing Company
CARL G. EOOY
Editor and Publisher.
Published every Friday morning
at Liberal, Seward County, Kans
Entered as second-class matter January 6,
1011,, at the post office at Liberal, Kangan,
under the Act of March 3, 1879.
"There's so much good In the worst
of us, and there's so much bad In the
best of us, that it doesn't behoove any
of us to speak 111 of the rest of us.
The New Game Law
The following are the changes
noted in the new game laws, as
stated by the Manhattan Agri
culturist;
There is no open season for ante
lope, deer, beaver or ottor for ten
years. For six years no Hun
garian partridges, English, Mon
golian or Chinese pheasants may
be killed.
The open season on tree squirrels
is September 1 to January 1; no
open season on gray and black
squirrels, or on any kind of squir
rels in the corporate limits of city
or in private or public parks
Open season on other game:
Wild geese, wild brant, wild
ducks, September 1 to April 16.
Plover, Aug. 1 to April 30
Snioe, Sept. 1 to April 30,
Grouse or praire-chicten. Oct.
1 to Nov. 1,
Quail, November 15 to Decem
ber 1, cut down from one month.
The new law also provides that
you must not shoot at wild game
birds sitting on the ground or on
the water, and these birds must
, not be shot at earlier than an hour
before sunrise or later than an
hour after sunset. You must not
shoot at birds from a motor boat,
or use live ducks as decoys.
LIMIT FOB A DAT'S SHOOTINO.
The limit for one day's shooting
is: snipe, 12; prarie-chicken, 12
plover 12: wild ducks, 12; wild
geese, 6; wild brant 6.
Women are affected materially
by the provision that "no part of
the plumage, skin, or body of any
bird Drotcted by this act may be
sold or kept in posession for sale,
irrespective whether said bird was
captured or killed within or with
out the state."
Fishermen might note that the
owners of artiiical dams are re
quired to construct fishways under
the direction of the fish and game
warden. The use of seins having
a 3 inch mesh is forbidden, except
during the spawning season. No
person is permitted to use more
than one trot-line, and such trot
line shall not have attached to it
more than twenty-five hooks, nor
shall it be set within 3000 yards of
a dam, or within 200 yards of the
mouth of a creek or river.
Meaning The Governor
Under the head, "Knocking K.
U," the Kansas City Star has this
to say in an editorial:
"The polititians who this year
cut down the funds of the Uuiver
sity $82,000 below the total of two
years ago have failed utterly to
read the Kansas spirit-"
Can this possibly refer to the
Star's friend, Governor Stubbs,
who vetoed a $10,000 item in the
university appropriation bill)
Meade Talks Electric Line
A party of Meade boosters in
cluding the editor of the News,
the telephone manager of that
place and others were in Beaver
the latter part of last week pro
jecting an interurban line between
that point and Beaver.
The movement is just being con
sidered and definito arrangements
have not been consumated but the
plan looks feasible and there is no
doubt but what it 'would be a
great boom for both towns were
the deal put through.
As we have often said before,
anything like a railroad or electric
line will receive the glad hand and
reasonable support of Beaver cit
izens if a bona fida proposition is
made. We need it, we want it
and we'll do our part to get it.
Beaver Herald,
Letter From San Benito
San Benito, Texas, March 25, 1011.
Editor Democrat:
Having promised a few friends that
I would write them from here
shall with your Indulgence, widen the
circle. This place is a& far south as
Miami, Florida, aud has about the
same temperature, but Is much dryer,
the rainfall averaging about 25 in
dies as against 60 Inches at Mlama,
The rains are not distributed evenly
through the year nor through the
growing season, but come In torrents,
mostly after a long dry spell. This
explains why Irrigation Is necessary
There are several Irrigation com'
panles In the territory. The soil Is
alluvial, very fertile, nearly level
but sloping gently back from the
river, making canal building easy,
The chief engineer of the San Benito
Company is the originator of Irriga
tion in the Bio Grand valley. Pie
built the railroad from Houston to
Brownsonla, and . in taking his lovees
to set grade stakes he discovered
that the bank where San Benito
stands was 26 feet lower than the
banks of the Bio Grand riyer. The
rest was easy. Capital . was interest
ed, a company formed, a very large
tract of land bought and work begun.
Land that was worth $3 per acre
sold readily at from $40 to $100 when
water was assured. This company
now prices Its lands at from $85 to
$150 per acre, In the brush, guaran
teeing water and drainage. I speak
of this company and town because I
know more of It than of the others
(which are all right), as my son,
Richard, has been here in the employ
of the company for two years.
The chief crop is cabbage, though
there are also grown successfully po
tatoes, lettuce, cotton, sugar cane
beans, also alfalfa and what we in
Kansas know as "teed" sorghum,
Katllr and maize. Grapes (California
white), figs and oranges are being
planted with prospects of success.
On January 2nd an unusual cold
spell covered this coast, the tempera
ture falling to 19 degrees. This near
ly ruined the cabbage crops then
growing, one half to three fourths
being killed outright and the balance
Injured so thr.t It did not head prop
erly. Immediately after this new
plants were set and the second crop
is now maturing and being shipped,
Three fourths of the sugar cane that
was intended for planting was ruined,
think I did not hear of anything
else being injured.
The town of San Benito Is growing
rapidly and substantially, though only
two years old the store buildings are
as good as those In Liberal and when
those now in course of construction
are finished there will be about the
same number of brick buildings in
the two places. No such large storks
of goods are carried here as In Liberal,
as the trade Is local and retail only.
There are now nearly finished a
canning factory and an Ice plant.
A contract has been let for a sugar
mill to cost $150,000.
Like all new countries, this has at
tacked numbers of people who did
not appreciate the difficulties of pio
neering. People Who had never farm
ed and were dazzled by the glowing
descriptions of real estate agents, and
who were carried away by the hope
of Immense and Immediate profits.
One has to learn farming here Just
as he does in other places. There are
a great many more successful people
than dissatisfied ones, and the count
ry is not in all cases to be blamed
for those who are dissatisfied.
Beside San Benito the towns here
that have successful Irrigation com
panies are Harllnger, Mercedes and
Mission. Brownsville, a town on the
Bio Grand.Jalso has Irrigated land and
is one of the old towns of Texas. Mat-
amoros on the other side of the river
is one of the Interesting places of
Mexico. Before our civil war It had I
a population of from 60,000 to 70,000
now It has dwindled to between 10,000
and 12,000. Brownsville was also trie
headquarters of Diaz before he was
president and while still a revolution
ist. A Hue rallroan bridge connects
the two places, but local communi
cation Is by row boats fare three
cents American or six cents Mexican.
The river Is now so low that a foot
way has been built to about the mid
dle of the stream.
One of the oldest railroads in Texas
connects Brownsville with the coast
at Point Isabel twenty miles east,
This is a narrow guage, and the en
gines and cars are of the original
type that you gazed at when you
went to the World's Fair. The new
est engine, No. 3, Is No. 4205 of the
Baldwin works, date 1877. The pas
senger cars are barely high enough
for the average man to stand In, and
the seats run along the sides. The
freight cars are of the same vintage
and dimensions. The ladders are Just
wooden cleats, and as I stood on the
old fashioned end platform 1 could
reach the hand hold on top of the
car, and 1 am not the tallest man In
Liberal.

Riled The Calif ornians
Every Kansan has read with de
light and pride the famous verses
of Miss Ester Clark, entitled
"The Call of Kansas." The verses
were written while she was spend
ing a summer in Long Beach, Cal.,
and the comparison she drew, in
which she expressed a preference
for Kansas, riled the Californians.
We are under the impression that
we printed it before but found it
among some old papers and can
not refrain from printing again a
parody written by the editor for
the Long Beach Press. He quotes
a stanza of Miss Clark's gem,
gives her credit for poetic skill
and then adds his amendment.
The two follow, Miss Clark's first
and the Long Beach version sec
ond:
Sweeter to me than the salt sea
spray the fragrance of summer
rains;
Nearer my heart than the mighty
hills the wind-swept Kansas
plains;
Dearer the sight of a shy, wild
rose by the roadside's dusty way,
Than all the splendor of poppy
fields ablaze in the sun of May
Gay as the bold poinsetta is, and
the burden of pepper trees
The sunflowers, tawny and gold
and brown, is richer to me than
these.
And rising ever above the horse
insistent sea, '
The voice of the prarie calling,
Calling me.
Sweeter to me than the salt sea
spray is the prickle of prickly
heat,
And sweeter than odor of orange
bloom, the Populist's sockless
feet
Nearer my heart than the vine
clad hills, a menu of dust and
erit,
More charming than sunlit bung
alow the gloom of a cyclone
pit;
Dearer the sight of a shy, red
nose adriD wijli the icy dew,
Than all the splendor of poppy
field ablaze 'neath a sky of blue
Gay as the bold poinsetta is, and
and the burden of pepper trees.
The Kansas whiskery of gold and
brown are the candy that catches
me.
Talk of the mocking birds' silver
throat in scented magnolia top
Me for the grasshopper's cheer
ful chirp annexing the sunburnt
crop,
And rising ever above the song
of the hoarse insistent sea.
The voice of the skeeters calling,
Calling me. Iola Register.

A fire that swept a path from
north of Woodsdale, 15 miles south
nearly to the townsite of Hugoton,'
was carelessly allowed to get away
from some farmers burning weeds.
t called for 150 men and 60 teams
with plows to control it and finally
put it out.
30 to 35 square miles of grass
were burned, but no buildings
altho some very narrow escapes
were told of. Such carelessness
deserves more than the reprehen
sion of the alarmed and disturbed.
There is a drastic law, seldom used.
for such disastrous acts. Hugoton

THE clothes, of course, are made for men but there are
two reasons why women like them and these two
cover every other.
They are thoroughbred in appearance. An air of refined
distinction marks every Sophomore Suit.
They are honest in value. Counting service and satisfaction, they
pay ur one hundred cents on every dollar paid in. Most women
encourage economy.
Sophomore Clothes are all-wool and hand-made made by expert
tailors who take ai much pride in turning out a perfect product ai you

Dear friends, passing through this world,
Here's a proverb you should know.
It will make your Journey sweeter
"Build your heaven an you go."
Heaven begins by doing right
Not In some dim distant start
Live today In saintly wine;
Heaven about you where you are. " .
I love little children, and it is not a
slight thing when they, who are fresh
from God, love us. Come, let us live
for the children. Let us learn to be
as pure and full of faith as they are
YOU WILL NEVEll BK SOBRY
For having a Rood life.
For doimr your level best.
For looking before leaping.
For hearing before judging.
For thinking before speaking
For being kind to all.
Mr. Hancock, accompanied by a
friend, called to see about the annu
al school meeting Thursday of last
week. Like many other clerks in our
county he could, hardly believe that
the AnnuafMeetlng was the second
Friday In April.
We would be pleased if the voters
of Seward county would accept the
suggestion of the stat9 superinten
dent and vote to' have their schools
begin the second Monday In Septem
ber. We would have no trouble then
with our monthly reports and bi
monthly examinations. All could be
given at the same time.
"I punished you merely to show my
love foryou," said the teacher.
"Tha-at's a-all r-rlght" sobbed the
little fellow, "It's a g-good th-thlng
I aim b-big enough to ret-turn your
l-love." -- , .
Mrs. B. F. Brown made us a short
call Thursday. She says that district
13 is ' thinking of building a new
school house rid keeping the old one
to use If necessary. This sod school
house has given the district good ser
vice and will probably hold together
till this school term is finished and
afford a "place for Sunday School and
church services until the new build
ing Is completed. This district is able
to have a good school house.
Mr. Odneal was In to see us last
week. He also is interested in the
new school house.
Don't forget that the annual school
meeting is April 14th, 11)11. All the
voters In the district shotlld be pres
ent at this meeting and vote to have
one of the best schools In the county
this coming school year. Remember
each district must vote seven months
of school and as many more months
as- they wish. Vote enough money
to run your school so that you have
a little left in the treasury, rather
than have to borrow in order to fin.
Ish out the school or have the teach
er discount her warrants to get her
pay. It Is really cheaper for the dis
trict to be always just a little ahead
financially. The state will help the
weak districts this year and will also
help the county so that each district
may have a seven months terra at
least and have their school taught
by a well qualified teacher. -
The teachers of Sewrrd county met
in the office of the county superin
tendent last Saturday morning and
reviewed the last chapters of "The
School And Its Life". All vof the
teachers have thoroughly enjoyed
this book and because of the study of
It they will make better teachers.
Here are some of the thoughts: '
"The work of the teacher Is spirit
ual, his difficulties have to do with
minds, and hence they are to be re-'
moved oniy by spiritual means.,,
"The right attitude toward the
pupil and toward his work is the key
to the higher success of the teacher.
Ills work Is to help each child under
his control to make the most of
himself.".
'Recognize always the superiority
of the home and its sacredness, and
under no condition weaken the au
tliorlty of the parents." ,
"A 'good school is a spiritual union
of teacher and pupil."
The other reading circle book
adopted by the state is "Elements of
Agriculture. " We very nearlv com
pletcd a review of this book and alt
the teachers liked it. Prof. Fulton
read a paper to us that was thorough
lv enjoyed by all. The teachers pres
ent requested Its pullcation, but Prof.
Fulton modestly asks us not to do so
as it does not come up to his ideal of
a paper on Farm Life. We hardly
know whose request to comply with,
so will take the matter under advise
ment.
The following are the names of
the teachers of Seward county who
purchased the reading circle books
adopted and requested by the state:
Prof. Rlndom, Clara Chlldears, Nor
Shaw, Chas. Dunlap, Mrs. Anderson,
Jessie Jordan, Gertrude Andrews, Lot

Saturday afternoon the Spelling
contest was held at the city hall.
Twenty-three took part In the con
test for grades 5 and 6. They were
Harvey Burns, district 26;
Frances and Wlllard llarnden, dist-
trlct 27;
Flossie Nix, Ethel Cain and Erma
Walker, district 4;
Delia Jester and Ben Richardson,
district 10;
Willie and Lu Orth, district 11;
Forest Franklin, district 9;
Fern Murphy, and Marguerite liar-
gadlne, district 22;
Claude Davis and Elijah Wright,
district 14;
Cecil and Ethel Davis, east school
of district 2;
Olive Lemons, district 24;
Cecil Pearce, Rose George and Har
ry Romer, Liberal schools;
Gladys Hubbard and Freda Turner,
district 22.
Beginning at page 49, John Boles
gave out the words to the class. Each
contestant remained In the contest
until they had missed theek words.
Little by little the class grew smaller
until all were down except Gladys
Hubbard, Erma Walker and Cecil
Pearce. These three spelled against
each other for more than half an
hour. At last the little girls went
down and left Cecil the winner. lie
received the banner for his school
for the coming year. As the judges
had disagreed on one word missed by
Cecil that the prizes should be divided
eqally among the threev Ray Mill-
man and Carl G. Eddy added $1 to
the $5 given . by the Economy and
Summers Dry Coods stores and each
contestant was given $2. This was
satisfactory to the audience as evi
denced by their hearty applause.
Cecil snowed a manly spirit by agree
ing to the division of prizes as sug
gested by the judges. Many were the
compliments we heard on all sides on
the good spelling of these two grades
five and six. The coolness and self
possession of little Gladys and Erma
was remarkable considering their
grades and age. Cecil had the self pos
session of the winner all through the
contest but the little girls sure led
him a close call. Cecil is a city pu
pil, Gladys Is from district 22 and
Erma from district 4. Cecil is the
oldest.
The pupils who took part In the
contest in grades seven eight and
nine vfere:
Hugh Harding and Clarence Iligglns,
district 25;
Mildred Harnden, district 27;
Harlan Ross, district 4;
Grace Bunting and Owen Jester,
district 10;
Lester Odneal and Alma Jerman,
district ltt; .
Violet Wilson, district 28;
Howard Nelson, district 26;
Wilda Davis and Bessie Lofland,
district 14;
Ralph Erlewlne, east school of dis
trict 2; "
Harold Sutton, district 2;
Ben Thompson, district 7;
Butler Wood, district 2.
These pupils began to spell on
page 115, lesson 150, part III, Prof.
Rlndom gave out the words to this
class as Mr. Boles had been pronounc
ing words for nearly two hours and
was very tired. It did not take this
class an hour to decide who were
winners. Clarence Hlgglns is a pu
pil of district No. 25 and he has the
honor of being the best speller In the
Seward county Spelling contest, hav
ing missed not a single word In the
contest. He won the banner for his
district and received the $3 prize giv
en by the Summers & Sons and Econ
omy dry goods stores, while Mildred
Harnden of district 27 won the $2
prize given by the same firms.
We wish to thank the boys and
girls for coming and doing their best
also the teachers who encouraged
them and also the parents, and last
but not least the judges-George -A.
Smith, Carl G. Eddy and Ray Mill-
man who so Kindly helped to make
the Seward County Spelling contest
success. We also thank Mr. II.
Hobble who so graciously and appro
priately presented the banners and
prizes to the winners. C. E. Woods
gave us the use of the city hall for
the contest just as he did last year.
On behalf of the teachers and pupils
of Seward county we wish to thank
one and all for their gracious, kindly
help. .
Come, let us live for our children.
Prof. Wm. A. McKeever of the
state agricultural college gave the
people of Seward county his splendid
lecture "A Better Crop of Boys And
Girls" at the city hall last Friday
evening. Prof. McKeever is doing a
work of inestimable value to our
boys and girls. It is the sort of work
that counts.

"Muckraking in the magazines

Dr. - Shailer Mathews, of the Uni

magazine making and forms his
opinion from intimate knowledge.
"The advertising of the country
is increasingly coming into the
hands of the big .advertising agen
cies," said Dr. Mathews to the re
porting class at the University of
Kansas. "Naturally these men
have some influence upon what the
magazines print, and they are care
ful not to favor anything that
may make the markets unstable.
"The big magazines, too, are
not as financially sound as may be
popularly supposed. Several have
been taken over by large capitalis
tic firms. When this happens, no
more muckraging stories are print'
ed in magazines affected. If Tom
Lawson wants to print any more
stories of high finance he will have
to start his own magazine." ,

Letter to Teachers.
Liberal, Kansas. April 5. '11
Dear Friend:
We are very desirous of bring
ing the teachers of the county in
to closer touch with the Seward
County High School. This is a
county institution and we hope it
may be an ever increasing factor
in the educational work of the
county. This spring we are offer
ing a six weeks' review in all sub
jects required for a second grade
certificate, and such others as are
justified by the demand. t The
work begins April 17 with Miss
Lottie Henline and the regular
high school teachers as instructors.
All teachers, persons expecting
to be teachers and any others of
sufficient advancement to profit by
the work offered are eligible to
this course. The Institute Course
of Study for 1911 will be followed
in all subjects.
Several persons have expressed
their desire to avail themselves of
this opportunity for improvement
and we hope as many more will
decide"to be with us Monday,
April 17. Perhaps you have pu
pils who would profit by this
course. Will you not urge them
to come with you?
There are no charges for tuition
and every effort will be put forth
to make your stay with us both
pleasant and profitable.
The High School has a small
but well selected library including
some of the best books in each de
partment of school work. These
will all be at the service of the
members of the review course.
The High School graduating
exercises will be given May 26, to
which you are most cordially in
vited. We will be glad to answer in
quiries for further information.
Very truly yours,
F. O. Rindom, Supt. Schools
Liberal, Kansas.
You can make more money by
investing in town lots than you
can by .counterfeiting. Let us tell
you about them. Phone 40.

About most wheel implements ia the oiling device?
' This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boxes"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call him, who
has been with thJohn Deere Plow Co,, for
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a Dust Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then fill it and keep it so full of good hard
oil that bust aud sand can't get m."
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease, When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box.

ends of the boxes, and flanged collars at the
inner ends. This wheel is found on Cultivators,

There is getting to. be a strong
settlement of Friends out around
Liberal, Kansas. As the Friends
church is noted for the interest its
members take in the education of
the young in every commuity
where they live, there is strong
talk of starting a Friends Acad
emy at Liberal. As there is at the
present time a discussion at Fow
ler relative to the discontinuing of
the Fowler Academy and the start
ing of a high school instead. The
Friends, many of them, feel that
their efforts here have not been
appreciated and are favoring the
moving of their interests to Lib
eral. They will wait until after
the coming school meeting and see
the outcome of this proposition

inducements to land such a school

Arbor Day, April 7th
Governor Stubbs has set April
7th as Arbor Day for Kansas. He
issued the annual proclamation Sat
urday and it is urged that every
citizen plant at least one tree. The
proclamation says: " When the pi
oneers of Kansas assumed domin
ion oyer the prairies they found a
treeless waste. Sinse then moie
than a million trees were planted,
adding greatly to the wealth of
the commonwealth, to the beauty
of the landscape. Therefore, be
lieving in the wisdom of concerted
action in tree planting, and in ac
cording to the custom of my pre
decessors, I hereby designate Fri
day, April 7th, as Arbor Day in
this state, and I ask and urge that
every citizen owning land or hav
ing a right to use it, plant at least
one tree that day.

Alone.
Napoleon brought with him tc
Autun a somber and pensive char
acter. He never played with anyone
an, ordinarily walked by himself.
He,, had much ability; understood
anj learned readily. While I was
teaching him his lesson he would fix
his eyes upon me with his mouth
open. If I tried to recapitulate
what I had just said he would not
listen to me. If I blamed him for
this, he would reply with a cold, not
to say imperious air, "I know that,
sir."
I had him under me for three
months. He had by that time
learned French so as to make use of
it freely in conversation, and could
write little themes and make little
translations. At the end of throe
months I sent him off with a certain
Monsieur de Champeaux to the mili
tary school at Brienne.
Ifapoleon's brother, Joseph, also
had much ability, although he took
but little interest .in study, and
knew no French at all when he ar
rived, he learned it very promptly,
as well as the beginnings of Iatin.
He was as decent and agreeable in
his manner as his brother was impe
rious. His nature was as sweet, en
gaging and appreciative. He was
fond of his companions and protect
ed those whom others annoyed. I
never saw in him the least indica
tions of ambition. From Jung's
"Napoleon and His Time."

NORFOLK WITCHE8.
There have been "witches" in Nor
folk until quite recent times. A
titan who died in 1883 was one of
three brothers who had ducked an
old woman in a pond berause she
had a black cat and wore a black silk
dress on Sundays. After a visit to a
public house they roused hor out of
bed one night and "actually in the
presence of half a dozen other peo
ple who had gathered to see the
sport, threw her into a hole, where
rthe would infallibly have been
drowned but that some who were not
so mad as the rest cried out that she
was sinking to the bottom and mus
be saved." Doctor Jesaopp also
vouched for the fact that a man who
was living and master of an ele
mentary school in 1882 had believed
himself in the 'AOs overlooked by a
witch, whose blood must be shed to
cure him. So he fell upon the wom
an and scratched her arms till the
blood poured from them. London
Chronicle.
TACTLESS.
"I don't think it was a bit nice
for the rector to commend women's
economy in dress," said the wife to
her husband after the service.
"That shouldn't have annoyed
you, my dear," was the reply. "Your
gown is plain enough."
"Exactly. His remark called
everybody's attention to what I had
on."

NEW CHURCH IN LABRADOR
Will Have Pewe With Backs and
Lamp Inataad of Candlee
aa In Old On.
Our houses here on the Labrador
codst are built almost entirely of
wood. Our old churoh, which was
built in 1814, is nearly 100 years old.
It is no wonder, therefore, that most
of the timbers in the foundation are
decayed and that the walls have giv
en way In places, to that often dur
ing a gale we fear an entire collapse.
The new church will soon be com
plete, and this autumn we shall be
glad to move into the new premises.
In more respects than one the new
church will be an improvement on
the old. In the former, the benches
were without backs, and during the
winter nights light was derived from
candles and the space was limited.
The new church will have benches
with backs, so that the worshipers
can sit comfortably, and the lamps
a gift from a friend in London will
not only give a better light, but will
also help to decorate the church. To
our Eskimos the new church is a
great innovation; they call it "God's
Igloo" (God's house). They have
not seen anything better or more
beautiful, and they believe it to be
the prettiest place in the universe."

Pathetlo Incident of Experience aa
Polio Reporter Related by.
Jacob A. Rile.
Jacob A. Itiis, the brilliant author
and journalist, was discussing in
New York his experiences as a po
lice reporter.
"They were intense experiences.
The pathetic ones had, indeed, such
an intensity that they couldn't be
used in literature they'd seem over
drawn. "For example, one cold and dreary
Thanksgiving evening, as I passed a
famous restaurant, I saw a little ur
chin standing before the area.
Through the area gratings the
kitchen, brilliantly illuminated,
could be seen. The cook, in his
white dress,' basted a half-dozen
great brown birds.

AN OLD WEL8H COAL MINI.
The Welsh coal industry, which is
now disorganized by labor troubles,
is less than a century old. Until
1829 the small amount of coal mined
in Wales was consumed locally. Then
the passing of the London smoke act
created a demand for smokeless fuel.
Two membra of the Coal exchange
journeyed to Wales and interviewed
Mrs. Lucy Thomas, the owner of the
Merthyr colliery, the largest then
worked. They found her sitting in a
hut at the mouth of the pit with a
basket on her head, in which she
placed the money as she received it
from the purchasers of coal. After
some difficulty and the production
of the purchase money in gold they
H?rsiiaded her to sell them a sloop
load at four shillings a ton. This
was conveyed to Cardiff on the backs
of mules, and when shipped to Lon
don sold readily at 18 shillings a
ton. Pall Mall" Gazette.
NO CAUSE FOR GLOATING.
"I suppose you've heard that I'm
going to marry Mr. Green," she
said to one of her old friends.
"No," he replied, coldly.

siastic about it."
"Why should I be? Not knowing
Mr. Green, I haven't any grudge
against him." Catholic Standard

Dry Farming Train.
The Rock Island people who are
very much interested in the de
velopment of this southwest coun
try, has placed a special train at
the disposal of the Dry Farming
Congress which will meet' at Col
orado Springs this year. About
twenty of the dry farming coun
. tries of the world will have exhib
its there, and Albert Steinal, ed
itor of the Southwest Trail is mak
ing an effort to have several of the
counties of this section of the
state combine and send an exhibit
there and later send the same ex
hibit to the land show which will
be held in Chicago in the fall.
This would cost a little time and
money, but we believe it would be
a paying investment for the farm
ers and real estate men to get to
gether and see that this section of
the state of Kansas was represen
ted. There is no more fertile
spot in Kansas than this southwest
country, and it would be rather
good to see our products take
first prize in such an exhibition.
The special train will reach Lib
eral on the evening of Thursday,
April 20, and an evening meeting
will be held in the cars here. On
the following morning, there will
be another meeting. This train
win cost tne itock island more
than we could afford to pay for it,
yet we may have the benefit if the
farmers of this section of the coun
try will take time to come and see
it There will also be a meeting
for the ladies, at which matters of
interest to housewives will be die
cussed. Two cars will be devoted
to this work. The train will carry
the best informed men on dry
iarming in tne country, among
whom will be Mr. Cottrell, Agri
cultural Commissioner of the
Rock Island. It would be a good
idea for the farmers to begin now
to make their plans to attend.

EXT SUNDAY IS EASTER and there is
going to be a great rush for hats, just as
usual. Easter is the one day in the year
when women all want their hats at the
same time, and often many a woman is
disappointed because the very hat she
wanted has been sold. Now, we have
made all arrangements for just such an
emergency. Our entire Millinery force has been work
ing nights for the past month GETTING READY FOR
EASTER. Our assortment is so large that you don't
have to depend on just "some one hat" which you may
have set your heart on. If it happens to be gone you
will find plenty more that you will like' just as well.
You Don't Have to be a Millionaire
to buy at our store. Our SPECIAL SHOWING next
Friday and Saturday
at $1.48 to $3.50 will be a pleasant surprise to all who
visit our Millinery Department.

this district long to tell -whether it
has a school teacher or a school keep

a telephone. Miss Nora Shaw is the
present teacher. She has done good
work considering her many grades
and her many pupils.

tor of district number 11. They are
well pleased with their school this
year.
Instead of making tardiness such a
bugaboo that tardy children will not
go In to school unless punished and
made to go, make the first Uve or ten
minutes the most Interesting part of
the day. Promise the children a
story. Tell It if possible, if not, read
It. Select short pointed stories and
read only part one morning then all
will be anxious to hear the ending,
Oftentimes children are punished
through no fault of their own and
they should NOT be punished, If
they can bring an excuse for being
tardy. Tell Johnnie or Mary that
much as you regret their being tardy
you are glad that they came as soon
as they could so as to learn and un
derstand as much of the day's lessons
as possible.
Mr. Norton of district number 24
called to see about voting bonds for
new school house. District number
24 has the lowest valuation in the
county, it has bravely built a little
soddy and held school therein for the
past two years. It is planning now
this summer to build a new school
house as large and good as they ar
able. This district although the
poorest In the county has had two of
the best schools- In the county tl
past two years.
. THBOUOn THE EYES OK A BOY
Dear Joe:
I've got started Into school here
In town now. I'ts a lot different
from the school at home. You can't
turn around without having a rule
for doing It. You can't go down the
stairs at recess unless there's a teach
cr along side of you, and you can't go
up stairs after you get down unless
a bell rings and there's a teacher
watching every time you put your
left foot out. Do you remember the
time Uncle John took us to visit the
penitentiary and we saw the "cons
go ln to dinner. Well, that's the
way we go. If anything should hap
pen that would send me to "the pen
someday, I'll be used to that part of
it, won't IV I've seen 10 teachers
doing guard duty around here al
ready and I've only been going three
days.
You don't have a tin cup to drink
out of up here, You go up and stick
your mouth against a pipe that
sprung a leak over a wash bowl, and
drink like a cow.
You got to go down cellar and eat
your dinner on a bench with your
back against a stone wall. You got
to put all your crums in a basket or
get sent to the office.
The office is the place where the
man 'who is IT stays. He is like
county superintendent only he visits
you oftener. He don't do no teach
lftg. He does the licking. I havn'
had a licking yet but I'm expecting
one most any time. I got sent to the
office today for calling her .'teacher
The man who is it was sitting there
wait lug for something to kick about
He asked me what 1 had done and I
told him "Nothing". He Jumped up
and said: "Young man, stand in that
corner till I tell you to move" 1
stood and he went out. Pretty soon
he came back and told me that if
ever I was disrespectful to Miss Rrown
again he would have to resort to cor
poral punishment. He said I was to
address her always as Miss Brown
and never be guilty of saying sucli a
vulgar thing as "teacher" again. He
said a lot more. There ain't much
in the office but a table and big chair,
There's a nail for him to hang tils
coat on and a basket of wasted paper
I looked corporal punishment up ln
the dictionary. It means "licking"
Joe. So that's what I'm up against
if I ever do it again. But say, if you
was a teaciier, would you get huffy
if a fellow called you that Instead of
"Miss Brown"?
H She is more stylish than your teach
er out there. She has a bigger wad
of hair and wears paint on her face
every day, but she don't sing out
"Hello, Sam" when she meets you on
the street. She just walks along and
acts like I wasn't in ten miles of her
She wears tine rings and a stiff collar
Gee! I wish Ma'd lot me go out to
visit you pretty soon. Seems like I'd
bust if I don't get somewhere so that
I can walk without a receipt for It
rue citv ain't wnat it's cracked up
to be, Joe. The kids don't know
beans here. She asked us yesterday
how many had seen a th resiling ma
chine work and I was the only one.,.
I'm going to get some marbles to
night I know a place where you
can get three dozen lor a nickel
Well, so long, Joe. Don't forget to
feed my dog. I hated to leave him
there, but you have to pay taxes on
him here. Your Cousin Sam

She Is Intending to take It to Beaver

ent of Beaver county. She is plan
ning to teach this summer. She en
joys the work far better than farm
life. The truly successful teacher Is
always In love with her work.
The Normal Institute for Seward
county will begin July 3rd, 1911. We
hope every teacher who is planning
to teach In Seward county next year
will begin now to make arrangements
to atteud. Many teachers have al
ready told us that they will be on
hand the first day and attend the
entire session and lend a helping
nana to maxe tnis .Normal the best
ever held in Seward county.
W. A. Wright of district 14 called

a play, tableaux and recitations.
Her father and brothers from district
4 were present and assisted with the

tertainment in the hlehest terms.
This is Miss Vivia's second term ln

been present If the scarlet fever had
not broken out in school. Mrs. Todd,
his kindergarden teacher and also his
(I ret teacher hi the public schools,
was present. He especially enjoyed
his presents a hunting Jacket, ball.
bat and book. We wish our little
friend many happy returns of the

will come and try to finish the com
mon school studies this year.

Local Merchants vs. Mail Or
der House.
From the Warrenshurg Journal
. This is one of the li vest question
in the whole country, from Maine
to California. In towns like War
rensburg and smaller, the local
merchants have contented them
selves with occasionally flying into
print with roasts for the mail or
der houses.
Well, the mail order houses have
grown larger and fatter on that
class of food, and the country
merchants, if they are yet in bus
iness, they are where they started.
Well worded roasts have had
the effect of advertising the mail
order people and the publicity
gained thiough wrath of the coun
try merchants has been at a min
imum cost to the mail order men'.
There is but one way open to
the country merchant to advertise
the mail order men in a way that
will count for the country mer
chant. That is to show the people
there is nothing to be gained by1
sending away from home after
goods.
If merchants can't make such a
showing, the town had as well
disincorporate and go out of business.
If there are certain articles
which the catalogue houses are
quoting below what merchants can
sell for, the thing to do is to admit it
publicly and advise people to buy
these articles, of the mail order
houses. There are such articles
because the catlogue houses have
leaders" same as other merchants.
Merchants should act on this
theory: That people will buy at
home so long as they get as much
for their money at home as they
can get at the catalogue house.
In fact they will go further they
will pay a little more for the priv-
ledge of buying at home, because
they can examine goods, get gaur
antees from the home merchant
whom they know is honorable, etc.
The reason people are sending
money out of this country for good
ies in the fact that people do not
know that home merchant can
compete with catalogue houses.
And why are the people so unin
formed J Simply because the cat
alogue house tell them what it has
to sell and the price, while the lo
cal merchants sit around waiting
for the customer to come and find
out what is for sale and the price.
Because of this contrast of met
hods people have jumped at a con
clusion that the silence of a local
merchant is evidence of his inabil
ity to compete for trade. The
ocal merchant's silence is construc
ted by the people as a confession
that the catalogue houses are the
cheapest.
The great and only resource of
the catalogue houses is the dispo
sition to silence on the part of the
countay merchant, and the latters
bad advertisment, when he adver
tises at all. (By bad advertising
I mean the familiar roasts which
are occasionally dished up against
catalogue houses.) .
If local mechants will quote along
side the prices of mail order house
citing catalogue number, etc., so
there are no strings to the propisi;.
tion, they turn the golden channel
from the mail order house into
their own tills. What the people
want is fact and figure. That's
what mail order men give them
why don't local merchants "fight
the devil with fire."

The Sound Sleep of Good
Health..
Can not be overestimated and
any ailment that prevents it is a
menace to health. J. L. Southers
of Eau Claire, Wis., says:
have been unable to sleep soundly
nights, becauso of pains across my
back and soreness of my kidneys
My appetite was very poor and
my general condition was much
run down. I have been taking
Foley Kidney Pills but a short time
and now sleep as sound as a rock
my general condition is much im
proved, and I know that 'Foley
Kidney pills have cured me"

Riverside School Report
The 8th of April closed the last
month of our school. On the last
day the patrons of the district and
neighboring schools brought a basket
dinner and spread It all together.
Everyone had a good time.
At 2 p. m. the crowd was called to
order and the program which had
been prepared by the scliool was ren
dered with their utmost ability. Ev
ery pupil did as was expected and
they got the praise for it. M r. Al
bert Perry favored us by furnishing
Violin music while we prepared for
the dialogues and drills. We extend
our thanks to him.
A prize had been offered the school
the highest number of headmarks.
The 4th grade won It. Rice and
Robert Davles tied on the highest
number, and Enie White, getting
only one headmark less than they, re
ceived the second prize. The was
kept away from school one day on ac
count of the river. Each child In
school got a headmark If they spelled
all the words correctly and no atten
tion was paid to being at the head
of the class.
Those neither absent nor tardy
last month were:
Ertlie, Ambrosia, Lizzie, Leola and
Irwin White, Rice, Robert and Ruth
Davles and Theodore Green.
Price Davles was absent but not
tardy.

day, being neither tardy nor absent
during the entire seven months.
Every pupil in school passed the
final examination Just as was expect
ed. That shows they have tried, and
trying Is half of It
Everyone was glad for a rest as
spring always Invites you out doors
and away from studies. We hope
everyone will spend ahappy vacation.

Artesian Wells
The state board of Oklahoma
which wiH have charge of the
drilling of the three artesian wells
in the pan-handle counties of that
state have been visiting the towns
along the line looking over ground
preparatory to letting the con
tracts. They also made a trip to
the artesian district near Richfield,
Kansas. The next row down
south of us will come on when the
board is ready to start the drilling
of the wells. Guymon claims she
has been promised the first well,
and it seems hardly probable that
the others will stand for that kind
of a deal. John Kelly of Hugo
ton has been busy the past two or
three weeks looking up the prop
osition for Stevens county, in com
pany with a member of the board
of county commissioners. They
were in Santa Rosa N. M. last
week looking up a competent man
to tako charge of the well. The
three jcounties south of us will
have $15,000 to spend on artesian
wells, and Stevens couuty on the
west will spend $10,000 in locating
artesian water, It really looks as
though it were time for Liberal
to wake up, and take a look at
this matter. If it appears that
there is a probability of getting a
good well here, it would be worth
considerably more to us than its
first cost.
Permission to Live or Die.
By the provisions of a new state
law which took effect last Wed
nesday the City Clerk of each in
corporated city is made local reg
ister of births and deaths. When
ever a child is born the attending
physician or midwife, under a
penalty of $50 tine and six months
in' the county jail, must notify the
clerk and get a birth certificate for
the child. Likewise in the case of
every death a burial certificate
must be issued by the clerk before
the funeral can be held. Lots of
red tape in this year of our Lord,
1911. Meade Globe.
Two This Year
There will be two eclipses dur
ing 1911 and both of these will be
of the sun. It is an unusual year
in that there will be no eclipse of
the moon at all.
The first eclipse of the sun which
will take place on April 28, will be
visible in this section of the coun
try just before sunset. The second
an annual e ent of the sun, will be
visible in America.
Nate Reece in the Stafford Cai
rier last week said: From the ap
pearance of a picture of Liberal's
new mayor, printed in the last
week's News' I would judge that
a case could easily be made against
the town- for a violation of child
labor law. Provided of course,
that, any labor is required in the
job of mayor.
Kansas Woodmen should feel
proud over the showing of their
society in this state. It has over
twice as many members as its
nearest competitor, and is gaining
much faster than any other society
January 1st this year there were
83,080 Modern Woodmen in Kan
sas, and they carry $135,000,000
of insurance. The entire society
carries one billion eight-hundred
millions of insurance. Can you
realize that great amount?

Wichita, Kan. These are -busy
times In the offices of O. A. Boyle,
who Is bringing the Big Aviation Meet
te Wichita, May 4th, 5th and 6th, for
It Is here that all the plans are laid to
make this meet as bis a success as
they nave baea In other cities.
And don't Imagine for a moment
that It is a small matter to see that
all the preparations are made, either.
First, there Is the question of getting a
suitable location for the meet a place
where the aeroplanes may start and
alight easily; hangars (a place where
the machines are kept) for the ma.
chines; stalls for the automobiles,
where every man having an auto may
reserve a location before hand; and
finally, the question of arranging seats
and the necessary enclosure for the

be' Is using more than ' one hundred

grounds. This requires considerable
thought and attention, but there are
other preparations which are equally
Important. For instance, getting the
people to and from the grounds quick
ly. The Arkansas Valley Interurban
company are tackling this problem in
earnest. A spur track Is being built
at the grounds, and an extra siding or
two for passing oars Is being put in.
Arrangements have been made for
enough cars to handle an enormous
crowd quickly and well.
And then there Is the publicity work.
Thousands of letters have already
been sent out to business firms, lodges
and individuals in Kansas and Okla
homa telling them about the meet,
and urging them to come. This work
Is already showing results. One busi
ness man from Falrvlew, Okla., was
About Base Ball
If We Want a Team This
Year, We Muit Get
Busy Now
"In the spring the young man's
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
base ball", goes the song of the
20th century, and it may now be
said to have tairly reached Liberal.
For the past three weeks, the
fellows around town have been
talking of a base ball team. The
only obstacle here seems to be the
fact that it will not be a paying
proposition, because it will cost so
much to bring the good teams
here to play. The town. supported
a good team two years ago, but it
was not a financial success, and
there will be some trouble this
year to get a responsible man to
manage a team here on that ac
count. D. 1). Land, who managed
the team here two years ago', has
received several letters from base
ball players who want to come
here this season. One letter is
from three fellows at Salina who
played league ball in Colorado.
They want to come here and get
into the restaurant business. One
of them is willing to manage the
team. Another fellow from lnman
who is a barber wants to come
here and play ball, if he can se
cure a job. With these four men
and the good material already here,
it seems as though we could mus
ter a pretty fast aggregation. We
have a good park here and several
good players. The only essential
lacking at present is the backing.
That is up to the business men of
the town. If they see fit to get
thrilling stunts known to aviation,
such as bomb-dropping, the ' Spiral
glide, altitude flights, etc.
These three days will be red-letter
days on the calendar of Wichita- On
each of the three mornings there will
be a big baseball game two Wichita
vs. Denver and one Wichita vs. Lin
coln. The Kansas State Association
of Elks will also have a big convention
In Wichita on these three dates, and
W. M. Dedrlck, who Is Acting Secre
tary, says they are planning for from
five to ten thousand Elks to be here
at that time, and witness . the flights.
Many of the wholesale houses and
traveling men are boosting for the avi
ation meet, and they say they expect
to see here on these days one of the
biggest crowds Wichita has ever had,
behind it, there is no doubt but
what we will be able to turn out a
winning team. It would be worth
the money to a good many, but
it will take the best support we
can give it to make it a success,
Newspaper subscriptions are an
infallible test of a man's honesty:
They will sooner or later discover
the man. If he is dishonest he
will cheat the printer in some way:
say he has a receipt somewhere or
sent the money and it was lost in
the mail, or he will take the paper
and not pay for it on the grounds
that he never subscribed for it
anyway, or move away and leave
it to come to the office he left.
Thousands of professed christians
are dishonest in that particular at
least, and the printers' books will
tell fearful tales at the final judgment.
Uncle Paul Hill and wife came
in the first of the week from a
ten days visit to their daughter
in Liberal. While there Uncle
Paul sold his small driving team
and bought a fine single driven
They are working hard to get
Uncle Paul to locate in Liberal,
but we have not consented to give
him up yet. He stopped in at
the office and moved his subscrip
tion up to Aug. 18, 1913, just two
months behind S. Derby. !

. Expression Recital.
The recital in Expression given
by the pupils of Mrs. F. A. McCoy
of this city, at the First Baptist
Church Tuesday evening, was a
great success. . The affair which
was strictly informal was attended
by a large audience of Mrs. Mc
Coy's host of friends in the town,
and the excellent program-unveiled
some promising talent. And
above all it portrayed Mrs. Mc
Coy's genius in training children
in the akward period of adolescence
for excelent control of the voice
and graceful composure on the
stage, and the two excellent Mon
lognes portrayed in their acting
and inotation a rare histronic ab
ility of the trainer. The music by
Kemper and Paul Funk was
smooth and harmonious and was
appreciated. The reading by Miss
Alice Smith was excellent and the
impersonation was of the quality
that holds undivided attention.
The selections by Maude and Edna
George were all good, and the
Monologue by Miss Edna, we
might say was above the average
for one of her age and experience.'
Miss Francis Walker carried off
her ludricous Monologue in a man
ner which the audience greatly ap
preciated. The numbers of Mr. Hugh Funk
were a surprise to all and he is to
be congratulated. The reading by
Miss Wartenbee was' excellent, it
showing an excellent memory, a
trained voice, perfect gestures and
Miss Wartenbee possesses some
histronic ability of her own. Mrs,
J. F. Funk as accompanist on the
piant upheld her part itia phasing
manner which helped to make the
affair a genuine pleasure to the
friends of Mrs. McCoy.

He groweth up like a weed in a
back yard and soon reacheth the
age when he is composed largely
of feet, freckles and an appetite
for pie, About this time he gets
too long for short trousers and not
long enough for long ones, he

About most wheel implements is the oiling device?
This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boxes"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call him, who
has been with the John Deere Plow Co,, for.
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a Dust Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then, fill it and keep it. so full of good hard
oil that bust &id sand can't get in."'
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a bo that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing ovqr with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box.
Deere Wheel tools have screw caps at the outer
ends of the boxes, and flanged, collars at the
inner ends. This wheel is found on Cultivators,
and Gang Plows and Listers. It is a

the account of the breaking up of
a religeous meeting in southwest
-Grant county ' by ' a ranch man
named Be'asley. He was arrested
with the "charge' of disturbing
public y worship and with assult
with Intent to" kill. An investiga
tion by the county attorney found
that tbe gun "which Beasly took to
the meeting would not shoot,- and
the latter charge wa9 changed to
one of assult. An exciteable suf-
iragoiro pecame luuiguauii i mia
and boarding a "train went to To
peki and told Fred Dawson, the
attorney genera) a wild tale about
the " miscarriage of justice there,
and asked him to take the case in
hand. He at once appointed John
W, Davis of Kiowa, a" prominent
member .of the last legislature, to
look after the case. Mr. Davis
went to Ulysses and took charge.
Judge Thompson thinks he will be
able to bear the case about June 7.
This is the first instance of the
attorney general taking a case
from a county attorney in this
part of the state, and the trial
will be watched by many people
' with more than ordinary interest.

of Lamed: ......
; Maude Muller stood one sum
mer day on the back of a go-devil

riding along the road and saw her

guaranty includes all material and all equipments (tires excepted) used in connection with the construction

ANOTHER MASTERPIECEIn announcing the E-M-F "30" Fore-Door, Full Vestibuled Body, Touring

that! Thou art to pretty to work
and toil and all thy virgin graces
spoil." Then Maude replied with
a stifling sob: "1 will tell you why
I am on the job. I am not a maid
en as you suppose, but have my
share of housewife's woes. My
husband he is a worthless sot, and
he will not work when the sun is
hot. So I am compelled to sweat
and toil and stack the hay that it
may not spoil." Then the judge's
voice grew stangely hoarse, and
he said, " I'd advise you to get a
divorce. Now I'm a lawyer of
some renown, and my shingle is
hanging in yonder town and if
you will go along with me, I will
fix the dope that will set you free."
So Maude and the judge to the
village went, as upon their mission
their steps they bent. And soon
they were ready to launch her
suit; and she told the court that
she had a brute. She said he was
lazy and mean of course, and be
cause of this she sought a divorce.
She further said, "if your honor
please won't you make him pay
my attorney fees, and alimony
for mv support and other things
that may please the court) She
won her case and was free once
more, and her haying days at last
were o'er; she had naught to do
but to fish for men, and in six
short months was married again.

nights, because of pains across my
back and soreness of my kidneys.
My appetite was very poor and
my general condition was much
run down. "I have been taking

'Ct M. Foster and MrHeffner
of tneBarden neighborhood were
heri Monday and stated they had
just received returns on a private
shipment of broom corn they had
shipped to Wichita over two
months ago. Mr. Heffner said he
waSj offered $55.00 by a local buy
er and had turned it down expec
ting to get more by shipping direct.'
This was the price he was paid
for the same corn in Wichita the
only difference being $15.00 de
ducted for expenses, netting him
$1(,00. Mr. Foster had been of
fered $70.00 per ton here but de
cided he also could get more in
Wichita and his corn netted him
$42.00 per ton. Besides the low
price received they had to wait
oyer two months for their money.
We could give you other instances
we could mention as quite a few of
our farmers who made shipments
of this kind took "business" trips
to" Wichita this winter but always
milntainod a very uproarious
silence as, to the nature of the trip
and prices received. We like to
see the farmers get the highest
prices possible out of their prod
ucts but in this case we don't be
lieve they bettered themselves
much by doing their own shipping.

Come, let v live for our children.
I haven't much faith In the one who com
plains Of the work he hu chosen to do:
He's lazy or elae he's deficient on brain
And maylie a hyuocrlt too; "
He'a liable to cheat and he'a likely to rob
Away with the man who flnda fau.t with hli
Job
But give me the one with the aun In his face
And the shadows all dancing behind.
Who can meet reverses with calmness and
grace
And never forgets to be kind.
The State Superintendent writes
us:
In view of the fact that we now
have a minimum term of only seven
months, permit me to suggest that
you urge upon the annual meeting to
set the second Monday In September
as the date of the opening of the
seven months school: It would please
me also If all contracts were made
with teachers to begin school this
fall the same date. All reports could
be sent In on the same date, All bi
monthly examinations could begin on
the same date There would be a un
iformity in the normal schools that
would be helpful to both teachers and
superintendent. Beginning school
September 11th, fifteen weeks could
be taught before Christmas and giv
ing one week's vacation then school
would close the last of March. This
will give the older children plenty of
time to help plant the crops and do
other farm work. In unity there is
strength. Come let us all work to
gether for the best good of all. If a
later date is better suited to this
part of Kansas than the second Mon
day in September let ua all unite on
that date. Maybe the third Monday
would suit this country best, Let us
try to try to have the schools begin
as near the same day.
Tuesday we visited the school
taught by Fred W. Taylor in district
13. We found the school orderly and
being well taught and the boys study
ing grammar with earnestness and
ernestness that did our heart good.
Boys CAN learn grammar.
Garden City is where the deeds and
contracts come from was an answer
given at the last examination by an
applicant.
Mr. Geo. Sallee of .district No 14.
Blue Bell district called to talk over
matters pertaining to school. He
lives so far from school he was wish
Ing that there was some way that we
could plan so that he could send his
children to - school next year. He
lives over three miles frgm the school
and his oldest child Is too young to
young to send.
Are you willing to forget what you
have done for other people, and re
member what other people have done
for youV Are you willing to stoop
down and consider the needs.of little
children and remember the weakness
and lonllness of people who are sick
or are growing old. Then you can
not only observe Christian memorial
days, but truly keep them. And If
for one day why not for all days.
Homer Freeman whom we started
on the high road to learning came in
and made us a little visit the other
day and gave us a beautiful Raster
card. We are glad to be remembered
by our former pupils.
Teacher (to little boy) Freddie
Brown are you making faces at Nellie
Blake?
Freddie Brown Please teacher, no
mam' I was trying to smile and my
face slipped.
Mr. Hancock was in Thursday see
ing to school matters Dertainlng to
his district. He has been treasurer
of district ' No. 7 for the past two
years and his work faithfully.
Mrs. DeCrow called last Friday and
finished up he reports to this office.
She has taught a very successful
school In District No. 4 the past year
Now lUs time for you to start to
school Rlggie darling. Good bye,' No
don't kiss mama, how many times
must I tell you that kissing is unsan
itary? O child! how could you pat that
dog? Now we must sterilize your
hands all over again and steam them
and then use the antiseptic spray on
them. There! now, are your anti
septic gloves. Get" your hands into
them quickly.
And here are two tubes of germi
cide and a vaporizer, gargle every
hour from this bottle, and sniff this
one every odd hour. Here's your
doctors certificate in its antiseptic
case: Show it to the teacher if he
Insista on cutting out your tonsils
again, and tell him I'm sure your ad
nolds have not grown again since
your operation last week.
Now run along dearie. Don't
breathe when the wind is blowing, or
any dust Is flying or any people pass
ing. Don't breathe at all If you can
help It, It Is very unsanitary with
the air full of disease germs. Now
do be careful, Riggie, and mind all or
the things I have said to you.
Wm. Rusco made us a pleasant vis
It last Saturday. He has just closed
a very successful term of school in
district 27. He is planning to attend
the Normal Institute in July and
further prepare himself for good and
effectual work In the school room
next year.
Miss Lottie Henllne has Just closed
her school In district 23. The patrons
gave her and her pupils a tine din
ner the last day, and a pleasant and
happy afternoon was enjoyed by all.
The parents in this district are well
pleased with the work done by their
children the past year under the di
rection of Miss Henllne. We con
gratulate Miss Henllne on her suc
cessful work.
During the past week we have re
ceived many pleasant calls from the
school girls Edna and Maude George,
Blanch Fuest, Ruth Wolley, Ella
Kern, Erma Clark, Matiel Evans, Cel
estlne Lane, Rose and Stella Tucker
and others. Come again, girls we like
to see and talk with you.
M. B. Cooper of district 10 was in
the office Saturday to get a blank pe
tition and will try to get enough sig
natures to call a special meeting for
the purpose of voting bonds for a4
new school house for the district.
The present school house in the west
part of the district is a sod school
house that the wind has nearly de
molished this spring. This is a large
district containing 42 sections and
has a frame school house In the west
ern part.
Teachers need to be constantly cau
tioned about attempting to make gen
eral rules and general plans which
they use mechanically to tit all of the
children in their charge. There is no
such child as the averagechild. There
are some children who come close to
the general average, but the teacher
will make many serious mistakes un
less she studies each child carefully
and by himself to determine whether
he is nearly an averagechild or wheth
er he is a very unusual and individual
child. The teacher must be a- con
stant student, not only of her subject
matter, but chiefly of the children
that she may determine the mind of
the child and Bt her teaching to that
child's mind.
The State Superintendent writes
us that the olerk should not make
out his report until after the census
is taken in June.
District treasurers, kindly report as
soon as possible the amount of mon
ey received from the county treasurer
since the last annual school meeting
in July, 1910, up to April 14, 1911, also
the amount paid out during that
time.
We are hard at work on the exami
nation papers and hope to be able to
send out the results the first of next
week. Many of the papers graded
thus far were excellent, while others
show a very poor understanding of
the questions asked. And we wonder
where the blame lies.
Hiram Jarrett and little daughter
and Mrs. White and daughter were
pleasant callers at this office last Sat
urday. " ; .
Last Saturday while working hard
with the diploma examination we
saw a little boy running toward the
courthouse. We stepped to the door
to see who it was and there was our
dear little Charles Edward Woods
Just back from his trip to Mexico,
where he had been visiting his grand
mother Woods and his aunts, Misses
Frances and May Woods. He is look
ing fine, so healthy and well. He
says he enjoyed his stay in Mexico
and can speak a few words of the
Mexican language. He told us that
his grandma was not yet quite well
enough to leave Mexico. The Misses
Woods look as though the climate
agreed with them also. We think
they are going from here to Rapid
City, North Dakota.
We always enjoy court week be
cause we see so many of the people
of the county and get a number of
facts concerning our schools. We
also have the pleasure of seeing and
talking with the eminent lawyers of
southwestern Kansas. Last, but not
least, we have such a good, hearty,
homey visit with our old time friend,
Judge Thompson.
While he cannot preach like angles
And perhaps not preach like Paul,
Yet his heart Is full of kindness
., He's a friend to great and small
Yes, to both the saint and sinner
To the old and the beginner.
He tries to do the right thing by us all.

: The bill the city of Hutchinson
paid for wagons for hauling away
the garbage during the clean up
there is between $1200 and $1400,
but the papers say it was worth

The recent term of court here,
has shown a growth of public
opinion along the lines of law en
forcement. At the time the ex
mayor was arranged for selling
adulterated milk, there was con
siderable criticism of the parties
upon whose testimony the warrant
and complaint was issued. At
the close of the trial last week,
there was hardly a man who had
heard the evidence in the case, who
did not believe that the defendant
deserved the penalty imposed by
the court. Lav; enforcement is
gaining in popularity here, and we
believe will continue to gather
strength.

ments, all made with "Plio Canvas" fronts, and'
lined with Skinner Satin, and guaranteed for two
seasons wear. Then think of the t prices being;
just a trifle more than it would cost you to buy
the goods and make it yourself. If you want a
suit, and if you (believe in economy this offer will
be pretty hard to resist.

That is what our millinery business is constantly doing. Right in the face of competition
our sales from this department to date show a large increase over a year ago. This is no doubt
partly due to the fact that the fame of this department is extending to other .towns and we are
now enjoying a large trade from all the towns west to and including Dalhart Texas. This shows
that people all oeer the country appreciate correctness of style, perfection in workmanship and
moderate prices. We handle the Gage hats and will have a shipment of the newest things prob
ably by Saturday. Come in and see them.

About most wheel implements is the oiling device?
This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boxes"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call him, wha,
has been with the John Deere Plow Co,, for
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a DuBt Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then fill it and keep it so full of good hard
oil that bust aid sand can't get in."
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work- into the box.
Deere Wheel tools have screw caps at the outer
ends of the boxes, and flanged collars at the
inner ends. This wheel is found on Cultivators,

made at once in the pumping ma
chinery at the city plant, to give
better service with the old equip
ment. The new council started

This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boies"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call . him, who
has been with the John Deere Plow Co,, for
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a Dust Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then 'fill it and keep it so full of good hard
oil that bust and sand can't get in."
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box.

THE STORE THAT GIVES
PREMIUMS
Cost Running Government
The average annual per capita
cost of running the government
under president Taft is $12.50. In
1900 the per capita cost was but
$10.78; in 1880, $7.30, and in 1850
$2.60.
This was one of the points made
in a speech in the house of rep
resentatives by John G. McHenry,
democrat, of Pennsylvania, and
just published in the Congressional
Record.
The speech was regarded as one
of the best of the session on the
subject of the necessity of a busi
ness administration by the dem
ocratic house, at least so far as it
may be able to control expendi
tures. The Pennsylvania member
mercilessly itayed Republican ex
travagance and wastefulness and
pointed out many places where
common sense business methods,
if applied, would save the people
large sums.
"That our system of government
and consequent burden of taxation
is growing out of all proportion to
the production and earning of the
people, is a fact that can no longer
be ignored," said Mr. McHenry.
"The idea that we can tax ourselves
into prosperity is a mistaken idea.
When the national governmental'
propriates $1,000,000, it must go
into the people's pockets for this
million dollars. Expenses of the
government must be met by the
people, but during past years there
seems to have been a popular in
creasing idea that the more money
the government spends the greater
the prosperity of the country.
The average annual per capita
cost of our national government is
about $12.50. Now, including the
cost of our state, county, borough
and municipal government, we
find an additional estimated annual
per capita item of $12.50 making
a total government tax of $25 for
every man, woman and child, . so
that the annual government tax
for every family of five persons in
America is approximately $125.
"When we come to consider,
Mr. Speaker, that the aunual aver
We are going to make them go, and that right quickly. To do
this we are going to offer them cheaper than we have ever offer
ed them before. Just look at these prices. ' m Think of getting a
$16.50 "Printzess" suit for $10.75. It is cheaper than you can
buy the goods.
$15.00 to $16.50 suits for $10.75 $17.50 to $20.00 suits for $13.95
$25.00 suits for $16.85 $30.00 suits for $21.50
This Suit Sale will last just one week beginning SATURDAY, MAY 13th and
ENDING SATURDAY, fifl AY 20th
age earnings for workingmen in
this country is less than $475, and
of this amount he must pay more
than one-third for the purpose of
government in time of peace, it is
time for all men to give this matter
their immediate attention.
"The past indifference of the
people on this matter has been the
first real danger signal for , our re
public. The burden of taxation
has now reached the breaking
point. The time is not far distant
when the workingman will demand

Fargo Township Sunday
School Convention
What was pronounced the best
Sunday School convention ever
held in Fargo township was held
at the Arkalon School House on
Sunday April 30th. What made it
the best was the fact that more
schools of the township were rep
resented, more persons took part
in the discussions, and a greater
interest generally was shown in
this great work.
The program as previously prin
ted was carried out with few ex
ceptions, no subject being ommit-
ted even although some of the
speakers were absent. Special
mention deserves to be made of
of the discussion of Teacher's
Training by Rev. Nicholson of
Kismet. The song by the quartett
from Hayne Sunday School was
highly appreciated by all.
The Co. Sec, N. L. Falls, in
presenting graded lessons repre
sented this as marking a new epoch
in Sunday School history. The
reading on the same subject by
Mary Falls was enjoyed.
The following officers were el
ected for the coming year:
J. II. Light, president; N. A.
Palmer, vice president; Mrs. Eva
Dodd, secretary; Mrs. Estre E.
Dodd, superintendent of home de
partment; Geo. Carter, superin
tendent teachers training depart
ment; Miss Gertrude Andrews,
superintendent primary depart
ment. T. II. Kirkpatrick, Sup. Adult
Dep., discussed Adult Bible Clas
ses and his discussion was very
much enjoyed.
Money was raised to send the
delegate, S. E. Dodd, to the state
convention at Topeka. This will
prove to be a good investment.
Although the day was very
windy there was a crowded house.
Considerable interest was shown
in the County S. S. map which
was exhibited and all were especi
ally interested in the removal of a
large "dead" spot from Arkalon
and South Liberty, as both places
now have large Sunday Schools.

That was well said. So far, no one has made

What a Joy It would be for us women and men
And what wonderful thlrofs we would do;
How straight we would walk and how straluht
we would talk;
Mow cheerful we'd lie and how Kay!
But If we're in earnest alioul our reforms
Why don't we beifln them today!1
. Mrs. Bunting who Hve9 in district
No. 10, called Monday to talk over the
promotion of her children which It
would be the wiser to do have her
children promoted at the end of the
term when they had been only about
three and a half months In the grade
and also had slipped the grade before
that. She felt that her children
would do better work to review the
three months work done in the grade
they rmd been promoted in since
Christmas and then do the remaining
four months of the work thoroughly
the remainder of the term. She says she
konws whether her children are in
the propergrades fully as well if not
better than the teacher has a chance
to know. We fully agreed with Mrs.
Bunting and advised her to see that
her children were allowed to be in
their proper grades next year. One
of the greatest mistakes a teacher can
make is putting a child In a grade
either too difficult or too easy. Most
make the mistake of putting them in
too difficult a grade and the child
thus handicapped soon loses inter
est and finally leaves In disgust.'
Miss Nora Shaw finished her term
of school last Wednesday in the Wide
Awake district No. 10. We under

Saturday, commissioner Taylor and

district No. 29, east of Liberal. The
following Is a list of the newly elected

Erlewine, clerk; Lucy Dettmer, treas
urer. $475 was the am mount asked
for maintaining the school for the
coming year. The new district starts
out on its own government from
April 2!), having been a part of dis
trict No. 2, and controlled by district
board of same. It is the smallest
district In the county consisting of
only sit sections, yet owing to Its
value of R. R that runs through It;
It will easy have a valuation of $100,
000. No new district can now be
formed witli a valuation less than
one hundred thousand dollars, since
the new law of state appropratlon for
weak districts went into effect. Nine
teen districts in Seward county have
a valuation of more than 9100,000.
No. 2, has a valuation of over two
million.

' Mr. Edison, the inventor of moving
pictures was asked the other davit'
he did not think the pictures are
harmful to young, people. .. , ,
"Why," Mr. Edison replied, "In a
few years every grammar school and
every high school will have A moving
picture machine (he forgot about the
rural schools) I'll Illustrate what 1
mean: The lesson today will be on
Mexico. First, I'll throw a picture on
the screen showing the geographical
relation of Mexico to America and
the United States. Then we will
have moving pictures of the principal
streets of the big towns. They will
show what Is going on In t hose streets
whether there are trolley cars and
such things or whether it is an un
civilized place. Then we might show
a motion picture, say, of a mountain
range taken probably from a R. R.
train. Few persons remember such
dry things as the principal products'
I would show pictures of the products
and show how they are raised. In
that way you see. F could teach more
geography in fifteen minutes than you
can teach in fif ten days, When the
machines and films can be had cheap
enough they will be used."

The new addition to the Mc
Williams auto garage was complet
ed Thursday morning. The addi
tion was built at a cost of over
$1,000, and it makes this one of
the best auto repair shops in the
west. It has a cement floor, a
pit, concrete bases for several
pieces of machinery, and is well
lighted and ventilated. The new
part of the garage will be used for
the increasing repair business of
that popular concern, while the
old building will be used for the
storage of the cars used in their
large livery business, as well as
for those of the regular patrons of
the establisment. They have also
installed a 287 gallon bowser gas
oline tank which is buried under
giound outside the building, and
the gas is pumped direct from the
storage tank to the cars, saving a
great deal in the cost of handling
it. A complete tire repairing
outfit has also been installed, en-

Artesian Water Here
A number of Liberal boosters
gathered at the office of J. W.
Baughman Saturday evening to
discuss the matter of drilling for
artesian water here. Expert well
drillers from the eastern part of
state were here to investigate the
matter, but no agreement between
them and local men was reached,
Artesian wells are coming closer
to us every day, and those districts
which have them are enjoying con
siderable prosperity now. It is
said that there were 500 visitors
in Richfield last week, and the
town there is on the boom. It is
much the same as other points
where they have drilled artesian
wells. If we are to retain the title
of "Capitol of the Southwest." it
will be up to us pretty soon to do
something along this line, and it
aepearsnow, that a definite step
towards securing a well will be
made in the near future. A letter
by J. W. Baughman follows:
Neosho Falls, Ks., Apr. 24, '11.
Mr. John Baughman,
Liberal, Ks.
Dear Sir:
I am anxious to get started to
drilling in your territory, therefore
will make you people the following
proposition:
We will'drill a well to a depth
of 2,000 feet. The first 1,000 feet
for $2.00 per ft., and the balance
for $3.00 per ft. You to furnish
all necessary casing. If artesian
water is found at less than 1,000
feet, we are to be paid for 1,000
feet, and you guarantee us two
more wells within a radius of three
miles of town.
Let us hear from you by return
mail it possible.
Yours truly,
Sulivanft Schnir.

Report of Bluebell School
SEVENTH MONTH
Our last month of school closed Frl
day which will long be rembered by
patrons, scholars and teacher.
With their characteristic kindheart
ed thoughtfulness the patrons plan
ned a surprise dinner for the teacher,
and.it was such a complete success
that niey almost saw the children in
costume for their Mother Goose exer
else. We were rehearsing our pro
erwn when a knock was heard at the
door and people began to pour in.
Not even the tiniest tot in the hrst
grade had ever given out the, least
hint of their intentions.
The pupils were dismissed at once,
and masterful hands made and set
tables fit for a king. The teacher had
to "Go 'way back and sit down."
In the afternoon the children ren
dered an interesting program, begin
ning with their open-air drill. Mrs.
Davis who had thoughtfully provided
a camera took their pictures. Then
all were seated and recitations, songs,
tableaux and dialogues occupied the
next two hours. The Brownie drill
caused much laughter and was appre-
lated by all.
Before closing the patrons tendered
their thanks to teacher and pupils
for a successful term of school and
the director and treasurer in a well
worded address offered to hire the
teacher for the coming year.
Each pupil in school passed the tinal
examination and not one fell below
85 In their general average.
Those perfect in attendance this
mohth were: Burton Neff, Oscar and
Walter Hammontree, Bertie, Harry
and Claude Davis, Clifford Wright
and Loretta Shellenberger.
Others not tardy were Grace Ham
montree, Alva and Elva McCullough,
Elijah and Gladys Wright and Wilda
Davis.
In conclusion we will say there Is
no better school In Seward county
than the Bluebell school and we trust
the district will always retain the
good name which It has won througli
the united effort of patrons and pu
pils. For without the combined ef
fort of these three agencies no school
can be a success.
Visitors from the schools of Misses
Alpha Davis, Amy Bowlesand Lottie
Henline and Mr. R. O. Flanders par
took of our feast and enjoyed the
program. We only needed our county
superintendent's pleasant face' to com
plete such a happy gathering.

Down That Way They Chase
i Jack Rabbits in Auto- 1
'' -mobiles
t
Liberal, April 23. "The last titae
I was here, fifteen years ago, they
gave a Jack . rabbit hunt in honor
of the visitors," said Senator Conk
lin of Hutchinson,, when he,: with
several , other Hutchinson men ar
rived here Friday night. i ,
; "There are not many jack rab:
baits here," apologized one of the
delegation that met the visitors,
"Most of, them: have been killed
off by automobiles. .That's quite
a sport nowadays. But we've made
other arrangements for your pleas
ure. , Tomorrow ' we're going - to
take all of the Dry Farming party
over to Hugoton, twenty miles
away, in automobiles."
The town of Liberal seems to
be rolling on the high wave of the
prosperity of Western, Kansas.
There are sidewalks here, but tbey
are not needed. Almost everyone
has an automobile and uses it every
time they go across the street. '
Liberal has a population of 2,374.
It's citizens admit it is the broom
corn market of the world. With
in the last year one hundred homes
and twelve business houses have
been built. A $15,000 court house
and a school house, that cost a like
sum have recently been completed.
A Bock Island hotel andaeating
house and depot that, together
with furnishings, will cost $125,000
are in course of construction. The
contract is ready to be let on a
$10,000 jail. A light, power and
ice plant is in operation. Liberal
has an application in to be made a
city of the second class. It' has
unusual switching and yard facili

About the Railroad
Last week we had quite a lengthy
conversation with It. H. Faxon of
Garden City, relative to the con
structcon of the road from Garden
City to Liberal. At present the
road is being pushed ahead on the
northern extension, , and it is ex
pected it will reach Winona, the in
tersection with the Union Pacific
by the first of July. The rumor cir
culated some time ago to the effect
that the northern line had been
purchased has not been confirmed
by the Santa Fe officials. There
seems to be no logical foundation
for the statement, for it is well
known that the Santa Fe people
have been blocking every move in
the construction of this line in
Chicago where part of the capital
for the project was raised, as well
as in the territory where the road
was building. The extensive land
purchases by Santa Fe men: thru
Morton, Haskell and Stevens
counties were made, it is claimed
for the purpose of discouraging' the
builders of the Garden City, Gulf
and Northern. Last week the $18
000. terminal bonds issue were de
feated at Russell Springs, the
county seat of Logan County, by
a vote cf 10 to 17. It seems that
the venture has been pretty well
opposed all along the line, but the
building of the G.C.G.&N. is still
going on, and is well into Logan
County at this time. ,
It was rumored that the bridge
south of Garden City had been
torn up, but this was only for the
purpose of securing the material
for the work north of Scott City,
and only a few stringers were
tat en from the bridge. . Antoher
feature which has hindered the
building south has been the fact
that Haskell County has been able
to raise only $19,000. of the bonus
of $25,000. pledged. It is probable
that these things will be settled in
the near future, and that the work
on the line from Garden City to
Liberal will be started as soon as
the line north is built to Winona.
Garden City is anxious to have
the line built from that place to
Liberal, and is doing what she can
to help the work along. . President
Tennis refuses to make any defi
nite promises at this time, as to
when the work on this end of the
lin will start.

(BY YE EDITOR)
The editor sits In bis easy c&alr.
Awaiting tbe dollars to come,
. His force has quit.
His rent Is due.
And his credit is on the bum.
0, Lord! How Ion will the battle last?
How long will we hare to wait
For subscriptions due?
From your neighbor and you.
Which for years have been charred on his
slate?
Don't your conscience prick Just t little bit?
Don't your heart a warning tell?
When you see his face, ,
And hear his voice
Like the wall of a soul In hell.
Don't you see his babies, shabby and cold.
Their faces pinched and blue?
When they might be warm:
Well fed-well clad,
With money that's due from you.
O, Godl Up there In your realms of light;
In Justice and love arrayed,
Don't let the delinquent
Pass the gate.
Until his subscription's paid.
The next sales day will be Sat
urday, May 6.
Hear the Meade Band
The Meade Band which will ap
pear in the City Hall April 27 tb
is one of the best musical
organizations in this sections of
the state. Under the able direction
of Prof. John Von Prosky, it has
gained an. enviable reputation
over the entire state, and has be
sides advertising Meade, attracted
a great deal of attention to the
south west part of Kansas. It
is indeed a privilege to have such
an aggregation of musicians as
these are reputed to be, in the city
and we believe they will receive a
very cordial reception here. . Fur
thermore, their appearance will
do much to encourage the boys
here who are trying to get up a
good band. The people of the
town will learn to appreciate good
band music, and we believe the
Meade boys should have a good
house to-night.

The Liberal Democrat
(Successor to The Independent)
Th Seward County Publishing Company
CARL 0. EDDY
Editor and Publisher.
Published every Friday morning
at Liberal, Seward County, Kans.
Entered as second-class matter January 6,
1911, at the post ofllce at Liberal, Kansas,
under the Act of March 3, 1971).
"There's so much good In the worst
of us, and there's so much bad in the
best of us, that it doesn't behoove any
of us to speak ill of the rest of us.
This number of the Democrat
marks the start of the fifth year
of its publication. The commn
ity has prospered and grown, and
in keeping with its growth, has
been the growth of the paper,
until it now stands first in size,
circulation, and we trust, in aual
ity of its columns of news. We
start this fifth year with the larg
est subscription list the paper has
ever had, and this seems to be
good evidence of the appreciation
of its reader. Both in the local
field and the out of town lists, we
have many friends, as well as en
emies. The editor has attempted
to advocate everything which he
believed was best for the commu
nity. You will never need to stop
and guess as to the policies of the
paper. Our policies as well as
our columns of news are written
in plain English, and we believe
that the reading public commends
that sort of a paper rather than
one that continually rides the
fence. The Democrat prints more
columns of news than any other
weekly paper in the 7th district.
A number of readers buy the pa
per not for its politics, but for its
news. Politics with us form a
part of the business, because we
believe that the opinion of the
public is moulded by the local
newspapers. In doing this the
newspaper assumes a great respon
. sibility, in that it must always be
careful to base its policies on facts.
The publication of facts is an es
sential part of the newspaper busi
ness, hence, its bearing on politics.
The editor is not a politician but
a newspaper man, and will give
the business first consideration,
taking as much activity in politics
as the occasion and facts may de
mand. If you like the paper, tell
others, and pay up your subscrip
tion when it expires. If you do
not like it, tell us and pay up your
arrearage. We do not care to
send the paper to those who do
not appreciate it.
One of the best jokes that has
been perpetuated on the republi
can party for some time is the an
nouncement that Gov. Stubbs will
be a candidate for U. S. senator
next year. That illustrious dic
tator, W. A. White of the Em
poria Gazette is said to be respon
sible for this new bit of informat
ion. The republicans are saying
as little about it as they can, but
the declarations of allegiance are
indeed few. Now this of itself
wouldn't be suflicent to up-set the
orninary man, but on top of that
comes the talk of the Seventh dis
trict lining up solid for Dick Hop
kins for governor. That is indeed
a rare joke. We know of nothing
at present that would more mater
ially increase the prospects of a
democratic governor in 1912, than
to have Dick Hopkins make the
race at the head of the republican
ticket.
. September 6,7, and 8 has been
chosen as dates for the county fair
at Meade this fall. How about

After years of service in the
army of his country, Siegfried
Padschelne has returned home and
is now visiting with friends in this
county and at Stafford. 'He has
been around the world, during his
enlistment, and has been stationed
in both Cuba and the Phillipines.
He owns a farm in Seward coun

Superintendent Shaffer, of the
Panhandle division of the Santa Fe
is quoted as confirming that the
Sants Fa will build an extension
from Belvidere to Dodge City.
The contract has been let, it is
announced, to ' the Johnson Con
struction Company of Amarillo,
Texas.v The new connection is to
be built fifty-five miles, from Bel
videre to Dodge City. The at
tempt to purchase the Buckliu
branch from the Rock Island and
use it from Bucklin on into Dodge
failed.
The new Santa Ee connection
will it is proposed, run from Bel
videre direct to Greensburg, and
then straight , west, crossing the
Arkansas river west of Greensburg
and running to Fort Dodge.
The object of building this ex
tension is to afford a cut-off be
tween tho Colorado and northwest
ern line and the Gulf line, and this
extension will shorten the haul
by nearly 100 miles between Colo
rado and the Gulf.
J. E. Conklin who is extremely
interested in real estate fn the vic
inity of Bolvidere, returned from
there a few days ago.
"There has been a lot of talk
about this Santa Fe extension and
it will undoubtedly be made, but
I did not know that the deal had
yet been closed" ho said today.
The Santa Fe now has a branch
line extending northwest from
Gutherie through Enid and Kiowa
to Hazelton, on the Belvidere
branch.
Through trains will be able to
run from the Gulf, via the Guthrie
branch across through Belvidere
and over the new cut-off to the
main line at Dodge and on west.
If the extension is built, as ex
pected, through Greensburg it will
give that county seat an impetus,
will tap a fine section of Kiowa
County now without a railroad,
and also open up to a railroad that
part of Ford county along the
onrth bank of the Arkansas which
is now without a railroad,

The following composition was
written by Kuth Black:
"THE FLY"
"The fly is an insect haying six
legs, a head, wings; thorax and
abdomen.
There are many kinds of flies,
the most important type is the
common house fly, because he is
the most destructive to life and
health.
A fly's wings are transparent,
and his eyes are compound or
made up of many small eyes. His
legs are covered with hairs.- The
hairs on his feet form two small
discs causing an air suction that
enables him to walk on the ceiling
with his back downward.
, His proboscis or nose is hollow,
he uses it to suck food with and
also to stick into flesh in order to
get blood. If he wants to eat a
hard substance, there is an acid
that flows from the proboscis that
softens it so he can take it through
this small tube. This proboscis is
rolled up close to his head when
not in use. The fly is developed
through its larvae and pupa stages,
being hatched from the egg into
what is known as the larva and
then developing into the pupae and
the fly. .
The eggs are laid generally in
waste and rubbish. Decayed veg
etables and stable waste should be
screened and protected from flies.
The fly may come from the barn
and after getting into the house
light in the milk or butter immedi
ately leaving all its filth and germs.
He not only carries dirt and filth,
butalso is often the bearer of typh
oid and other dreaded diseases.
There are many ways to destroy
the fly and everyone should try
and get rid of him, posion may be
fixed for them, or sticky fly paper
may be spread where they fre
quent. A swatter can be used
100. It would be a great help to
wards his destruction if more
cleanly habits were adapted in the
kitchens and stores and not only
these places but the stable and
other places where waste and rub
bish gather."

Good clean runs are a delight to
hens.
Sometimes litter gets so hlthy that
it is worse than none.
Turkey eggs set this month should
give good salable carcasses for Christ
mas feasts.
Leave it to tiie old hen to pick out
the best nest to lay in. Site can do
that better than you can.
Two sprinklings a week with kero
sene oil should keep the house free
from Insect pests. But be thorough
Get the screens over the windows
now, so that intruders will not dis
turb your favorites while they are
asleep at night.
Are you troubled with crows about
your ciucken yards cover the pens
with wire netting. That will fool
the thieves.
overfeeding must be avoided as
must also underfeeding. Either ex
treme will stunt the growth of the
young stock.
. Can't expect to succeed with broody
hens, incubators and little chicks,
these days, unless we stay close at
home to meet all emergencies.
Feed very little soft feed and you
will raise more chicks. If you must
feed soft stulT don't throw it upon
the ground. Feed It in a small trougl
or on a clean board.
In heavy-soil localities, gapes are apt
to attack young chicks, especially
when quartered on damp, heavy
ground. In light, sandy soils this
disease is practically unknown.
Look suspiciously at eggs that have
been laid in a stolen nest. They may
be alright, but test them carefully
lest you lead someone who buy
them to say tilings that will make
your ears burn.

follows: First those who oppose

run it down to strangers, third
those who distrust public spirited

vertise their business, fifth, those
who never show any hospitality to

that doesn't originate" with them

long faces when a stranger talks
of locating in town, ninth, those
who oppose every public enter
prise which does not appear oi

man who tries to do something in

Harmony Talk
Several newspapers are com
menting on editorials which re
cently appeared in the Bellville
Telescope urging that all the fac
tions in the Republican party
should get together.
The Telescopo is exactly right,
provided the Republican party
wants to win. But the trouble
with too many of the bosses who
now control the party organiza
tions in Kansas is that the only
way they will get together is to
let the other fellow lie down and
be walked on. This sort of "har
mony" is impossible and the gentle
men who aspire to do the steam
roller act will find that their mach
ine stalls from lack of power.
A man can be a republican and
be in favor of the recall ot judges
and he can be one and oppose the
recall. He can be a Republican
and be for or against the Canadian
reciprocity. He can be a Repub
lican and favor ship subsidy or op
pose it. The fool part to play is
to read a Republican out of the
party because he does not believe
n all the things that you do.
And that is why the present Re'
publican leadership in Kansas is
headed for the ditch.

An ordinance was presented to
the city council Tuesday evening
by the Western Union Telegraph
Co. The ordinance if passed, will
give the Telegraph Co the right to
set their poles and string their
wire in the streets and alleys of
the city. The passage of the ordi
nance seems to be the first step
toward establishing an uptown
telegraph office. The change will
be of considerable convenience to
the business men of the town, and
will probably increase the business
of the Western Union at this
point.

CUTTING A BIRD'S TONGUE
Many Peopto Believe Slitting of the
Tongue Necessary to Make
Bird Talk.
"It is extraordinary," says a
writer in the Strand, "how many
persons are under the impression
that, in order to enable a bird to
talk, it is absolutely necessary to
cut or split its tongue." All men who
keep bird-shops in England, accord
ing to him, seem to believe in it, and
one such man declared that splitting
their tongues made them " split the
words. He continies:
"Some time back Miss Elsie Clerc,
of the Alhambra, who is a breeder
of fancy canaries, heard Jack, and
spoke of him to Sis Herbert Tree,
who keeps a number of pets. 'A very
beautiful bird, no doubt, but I dis
like the cruelty of cutting their
tongues !' said Sir Herbert, I need
hardly add that Jack's tongue ha
not bsen cut.
"I have heard that this fallacy
had its origin in the following story:
A man had a number of starlings in
a large cage marked 'Fine young
starlings only one shilling each
and as each would-be purchaser ar
rived, the man would say, 'There's a
fine bird there, sir,' pointing out one
of thera ; "but I want half a crown
for him, because he's the only one
with a cut tongue, so he is bound to
be a talker.' He would then proceed
to catch the bird and show the cut
tongue, and invariably succeeded in
effecting a sale. This dodge would
be repeated a each new customer
arrived, and departed rejoicing at
his good bargain. The reader, per
haps, i9 not aware that all starlings
have a very peculiar formation at the
extremity of the tongue, which gives
the appearance of a little piece hav

It is rumored that on the 20th
of this month, the Rock Island
will discontinue trains 33 and 34,

Woods' Barn Burned
Abhut3:00 o'clock Wednesday
morning tte town was aroused by
the whistles of the round house
and two engines'! The fire was
the barn of C. E. Woods in the
southwest part of the city. Be
fore any one could reach the scene
of action, the. blaze was so well
started it was impossible to save
the children's pony, Meg. The
city water was turned off at 10:00
o'clock, and no water water was
available, until it was turned on at
the plant. The loss was estimated
at $400, with only $100 insurance.
The rain Tuesday evening prevent
what might have been a serious
fire, as a strong wind was blowing
from the South.
Some of the coal iD the north
part of the stable was saved. The
entire Woods family are wearing
long a faces today because of the
lose of the pony. James dug a
grave in the yard yesterday and
the remains of poor Meg was bur
ied there. The property loss was
not great, but poor Meg can never
be replaced. Indication are that
the tiro was of incendiary origin.

tires were destroyed. The loss
was not covered by insurance. As
the car stopped Mr. Cavanaugh
headed it towards the wind, so the
"engine was not damaged. It is
thought that a new body, new

TWO OLD WAR PAPERS
One Issued at Springfield
And Other at Liberal
While Companies
Were There
There were -two newspapers
published in Southwest Kansas
nineteen years ago which are not
to be found in the files of the State
Historical society, or in any other
newspaper files of the state.
They are the "Camp Ricksecker
Guard" published at Springfield,
Seward county.
There were but a few numbers
issued. Harry II. Taylor, now in
-the automible business in Hutchin
son, was one of the editors and
publishers of the "Guard," for it
was all the same paper.
It was issued by the boys of
Company E, of Hutchinson and
Company H, of Sterling, when
they were on duty during the
county seat war" in 1892.
Harry Taylor and Bob Miller, a
Hutchinson printer, were members
of Company E. Link Magee was
a member of the Sterling company.
They decided to relieve the mo
notony of camp life by issuing a
little newspaper.
While the companies were at
Springfield the "Guard" was prin
ted in the office of the Springfield
Republican. "Vol. 1. No. 1" was
issued on .January 11, 1892.
Three days later the companies
were transferred to Liberal, where
two issues of the little camp paper
were printed in the office of the
Liberal Lyre, then edited by Miss
Myra McDermed, now Mrs. C. G
Stevenson, a prominent club
woman of Pratt. Mrs. Steven
son, who is visiting in Hutchinson
possesses copies of the '.'Guard"
printed in both Liberal and
Springfield.
The little paper consisted of one
three column slip printed on both
sides and was really a good typo
graphical piece of work. It con
tained some advertising, lifted
from the forms of the local papers
to fill space. It bore at its mast
head this announcement:
"Published only during insur
rection." The Farewell to Liberal
On leaving Liberal Company E
bade farewell with this editorial
in the Guard:
"It is with regret that we bid
farewell to the citizens of Spring
field and Liberal and hope their
cup of happiness will always be
full. While both companies
would like to remain we much
regret the cause that brings us
here. Seward county has the
brightest prospects before it and
when this factional strife is over
it is bound to be one of the most
progressive counties in the state."
Hutchinson News.
Meade Band is Good
, The Meade band played a con
cert here -last Thursday evening
which was one of the best musical
entertainments that has visited
Liberal this season. It is indeed
,too bad that they didn't have a
crowded house. There was a
missionary rally in progress at
one of the churches, and a number
of other -functions in town that
night that tended to make the
crowd at their concert smaller
than it would have been otherwise.
The band is good, and shows the
excellent training they have had
under the able direction , of Prof.
John Von Proskey, who is prob
ably the best musician in thi sec
tion of the state. In the afternoon
the boys played several numbers
on the street, and then were taken
around town in automobiles. "-E1-lsaesser,
Woods & Henry, the pro
gressive real estate men, were at
the head of the procession with
their big Mitchell Six, and had
their banners hung on the sides of
the car. The Meade fellows are
all gentlemen, and their band is
giving that town some mighty fine
advertising.
John Lahey who has lived on
his farm northeast of Woodsdale,

House its Own Master
The fact that a majority of the
members stand for the passage of
the reciprocity measure and the
farmers' free list bill is the best
evidence that the house is no long
er controlled by the tariff trusts.
Lumber, for instance, would
not go on the free list if Big Bus
iness was still in control. Hereto
fore the lumber interests the
same interests and individuals that
are alleged to have elected and re
tained Lorimer in the senate
have been able to prevent lumber
from going on the free list.
. The fact that wire fencing and
other steel manufactures are placed
upon the freelist, and that a sweep
ing investigation will soon be un
der the Stanley resolution, is pos
itive assurance that the steel
barons are no longer able to dic
tate the kind of legislation that
the house shall or shall not enact.
It is evident that the implement
combine has lost its grip on the
house, because agricultural imple
ments, including plows, harrows,
reapers, binders and mowers ap
pear on the farmers' free list.
- Nor is the beef trust still in
command. If it was, dressed
meats would continue to be taxed,
instead of going on the free list,
as the democratic program pro
vides. Hutchinson Gazette.
-Wilson-Coons.
A wedding of unusual interest was
that of Miss Rose Coons and Mr. Jos
eph Wilson, both of Canton, who
were married Sunday afternoon at
5 o'clock at the home of the bride's
father, Pete Coons. About forty rel
atives were present, including the
bride's brother from Topekat one
from Oklahoma and her sister, Mrs.

They are Looking to the
Southwest
Up in Illinois, 'the big broom
corn center of the world, they are
figuring that the broom corn must
come from down in here if it
comes at all in the years ahead.
Local brokers in Mattoon, Illinois,
declare the era of Illinois' broom
corn sorn supremacy is at an end
and the palm for production of
brush must hereafter go to Kan
sas, Oklahoma and the great south
west. For twenty years Mattoon,
Illinois, has been the broom corn
center of the country, for Coles
county has raised a greater a
mount of the valuable product
than any similar sized area in the
world. The excessive cost of pro
duction of broom corn in Illinois
as compared to the new field is
given as the reason for the change.
Farmers living in Cumberland
County banded together and a
greed not to raise broom corn for
five years unless dealers would
guarantee a price of not less than
$120 per ton in advance of plant
ing. To this declaration W. M.
Checkley of Mattoon, Illinois, a
prominent broker, replied; "If
you cannot raise broom corn for
less than $120 per ton, you had
better quit because the farmers of
Kansas and Oklahoma can raise it
for less than $100 a ton. The land
in those states can be bought for
about one-fourth of the value of
Illinois land. Labor is cheaper
and market conditions are becom
ing equally good. In my opinion,
Illinois must cease to raise broom
corn, for it will no longer pay."

County School News.
Come, let os live for our children.
Friday we visited the school in
district 10, Wideawake. We found
the children and teacher true to
their name in every particular.
Promotions will be made in all the
grades except one. It is thought
best to have this gtade review
their work and thoroughly master
same before taking up the new
and hard work of the grade. One
of the greatest mistakes a teacher
can make is promoting a child be
fore it is mentally strong enough
for the next grade or promoting
for popularity. Let us make
haste slowly.
One school board in Kansas has
taken a stand on card playing and
dancing, They adopted the fol
lowing resolutions at their first
board meeting after the annual
election:
v"Whereas our children spend
from nine to twelve years and
sometimes more, in our public
schools; and when they graduate
they are young men and women
with habits and character largely,
if not entirely, formed, and the
school influences of these twelve
or more years are largely and in a
large majority of cases wholly re
sponsible for their future; hence
the influences of the teacher must
have a greater bearing on the
child than can have those of the
minister or even the parents;
therefore, be it resolved, that
all teachers employed in this
school shall enter into a signed
contract, one of the expressed
conditions and agreements of which
shall be that such teacher shall
during the full term of said con
tract refrain from dancing and
card playing and shall in every
way conduct themselves in a man
ner fitting and becoming the digni
ty of their positions: the violation
of any of which shall cause such
contract to be null and void and
cause the position of such teaeher
to become v&ant."
We have heard these same
thoughts from many parents in
Seward county in regard to, card
playing and dancing. We are
also glad to say that few, if any
of our teachers do either.
Nearly every school district in
Seward county sends us the mes
sage, "Send us a good teacher,
one who will help us train our
children in ways of goodness, one
who will help lift us up on higher
ground, one who will be an in
spiration and heaven for us all.''
Mrs J. A. Hall and children
spent an hour or so with us last
week while waiting for her hus
band who was on the jury.
Messrs Watson, Swink and Ma
lone called on business relating
to their schools several times last
week. . v
Rev.T. B. Lawrence, the new
missionary minister for this dis
trict, and wife made us a pleas
ant call one day last week. They
have a daughter, Miss Bertha Law
rence, teaching in Galena, Kansas.
They also have a son, James, who
is planning to teach. They are
very pleasant people and are en
joying their new experience of life
in our western country.
A letter from Prof A. L. Stickle
of Harper county, received the
first of the week asks us to give
his regards to friends in Seward
county. Prof Stickle will assist
us with the normal in July. The
normal will begin July 3d, and we
hope every one who is intending
to teach in Seward county for the
year 1911-12 will plan to attend.
We enjoyed several pleasant
little visits and calls with Mrs
Stout and Miss Bush of Arkaon
the past week. Mrs Stout's little
son barely 13 years old, passed
successfully the two subjects,
reading and physiology in the late
examination for grades toward a
common school diploma. He is a
7th grade pupil in the rural schools
at Arkalon, and has completed
the two branches that the state
requires to be completed in that
grade. Next year he will . be in
the 8th grade and the state will
expect him to complete orthogra
phy, grammar and geography. In
the 0 th year or 0th grade he will
complete arithmetic, penmanship,
Kansas and U. S. history, civics
and agriculture We feel sure
that Ward will be a winner two
years hence.judging from his faith
ful work at the last examination.
Many thanks to Miss Henline
for assistance rendered to us in
helping grade the examination
papers. Also to editors Millman
and Eddy for their help in grading
the papers in Kansas history.
Two little girls of six and seven
heard a party of older people dis
cussing skeletons. The six year
old girl listened intently to the
conversation when the seven year
old girl said with an air of superior
knowledge, "You don't know what
a skeleton is and I do.' "So do
I," replied the six year old, "I
know for certain I do." "Well
what is it?' said the elder. "Why
its bores with the people off, thats
what it is."
Mrs Lofland and little daughter
called Saturday to see about the
next examination for common
school diploma, Her daughter,
Bessie, tried at the last one. and
will try again for higher grades.
Mr Rusco will please accept our
thanks for assistance with exami
nation papers.
Mr Orth of district 11, the new
ly elected treasurer, came in Sat
urday and took the oath of office
and furnished bond satisfactory
to the director and clerk. Mr
Shaffer wes also present.
Elzie Pile also called and quali
fied and gave his bond foi school
district No l's school funds. Both
Mr Orth and Mr Pile have been
reelected to office of treasurer.
Mrs Harry Evans made us a
pleasant little call in the interests
of her school district Mrs Evans
is clerk of district No 1. Both she
and John Edmonds who is director
of the same district, approved of
Mr Pile's bond. ,
Mr Davis and son and Bessie
Odneal and Wilda Davis called
Monday on business and pleasure.
Mr Hall called and took out the
walnuts for his little boys.
Mrs A. H. Thompson and
daughter Sarah, called to see us
in regard to the examination
next Thursday and Friday,4 May
4-5. Miss Sarah is completing the
8th years' work in the common
schools and hopes to graduate
from that next year and receive
a common school diploma. Miss
Hattie Seeley is in the same dis
trict and is planning to do the
same.
Next Thursday and Friday.May
4-5, the state will give an exami
nation for common school diploma
This is especially for schools hav
ing a nine months' term. Arith
metic, penmanship, U. S. history,
orthography, geography and class
ics will be given Thursday. Gram
mar, Kansas history, civics, read
ing and physiology will be given
Friday. Those who failed in the
last examination in any branch
may come and try again for
grades toward a common school
diploma.
One of the questions in Kansas
history was. does Kansas occupy
an advanced moral position among
the state? Give reason for your
answer. Here are some of the
answers: Yes, because it passed
a law prohibiting the sale of in
toxicating liquors and cigaretts.
Yes, because of its crops of potatoes.
Yts because she is the leading
state in education, agriculture and
arms.
' Yes because in the war the
people were so brave.
Yet because it has so many ed
ucational institutions and it is a
prohibition state.
Yes, the reasons are it has good
schools it ranks high in farm pro
ducts also in manufacturing salt
which is the largest in the world.
We also have the largest broom
corn market in the world at Liberal.

The recent action of the council
in making an effort to provide
street lights is indeed a commend
able one. Aside from adding to
the convenience of the public, the
lights would put an end to petty
law-breaking. The town has an
ordinance which forbids the drink
ing of liquor in the streets, on the
sidewalks, or in the approaches of
any of the business buildings, yet
it is almost impossible to enforce
the ordinance. Better lighted
streets would make it easy to rec
ognize the violators of the curfew
ordinance. It is probable that only
a few street lights will be provided
just now, but the adage puts it
that great things come from small
beginnings. '
The W. C. T. U. has been great
ly interested in the laws which
protect the children, and indeed,
this is quite the proper sphere for
the activity of the mothers. We
have a number of ordinances here,
which are good, but their enforce
ment should be given more atten
tion. It would greatly aid the
business men of the town who sell
tobacco, and conduct pool halls, if
they could be furnished with a list
of names of the young men of the
town who are really grown-up, but
lack a few years of reaching the
birthday which enables them to
vote. We believe there are few
business men who intentionally
violate the law, , and such a list
would give them a change to pro
tect themselves.
It is rather early to get up any
great amount of enthusiasm, but
it is essential to the success of the
venture, that if we are to have a
real celebration here on the fourth
ot next July, we should begin to
get busy. A numbor of good at
tractions could bo secured, and we
believe that the town could well af
ford to spread itself on the next
Fourth. The abseuce of any or
ganization to take hold of the mat
ter should not make it impossible
to give the people in and around
Libeial the best celebration they
have ever seen, and it takes only a
few live wires to make it a reality.
If we are to have a celebration this
year, let's start the ball rolling in
time to make plenty of preparation.
Land to the Santa Fe
It looks very much as though
Seward county was to have at least
a part of the new extension of the
Santa Fe, which, it is reported,
will be built this summer from
Dodge to a point in New Mexico.
The deeds for a little over 16,000
acres were sent here last week to
Chas. Finley, Register of Deeds,
and the transfer was published in
the Democrat last week. The
transfer was made by Sen. Stewart
and his wife to the Santa Fe Im
provement Company. This is said
to really be the Santa Fe Railroad
Co., and it is deemed a significant
fact that the deeds were sent here
for recording by E. L. Copeland,
treasurer of the road. The land
does not lie in a connected body,
but is scattered, the greater part
of it being in the northwest part
of the county. The Dodge people
are quite enthusiastic over the con
struction of the new road, and be
lieve that it will be built some time
this summer. A great amount of
the land in this transfer lies along
the river, and it looks as though
the purchaser Vere looking for a
good point to cross the river.

"Drifting"
Drifting along in a red canoe,
Jonathan Blank and beautiful Sue;
Jonathan dressed in his gladsome
rags, hero of more than dozen jags;
smoking a red-hot cigarette, John
is a dead game sport you bet.
Susie thinks, as she sees him smoke,
"John will never be fully broke,
for his dad, the Honorable Henry
Blank, has barrels of money in
yonder bank, and John has noth
ing on earth to do, but paddle
around in this red canoe. John is
a little bit lazy, I think, but that
doesn't matter he's got the chink.
In tbose beautiful rags he sure is
a dear, tho when he is drunk he's
a trifle queer. And so let us drift
by the light of the moon, while
John and I have a quiet spoon."
That was a long, long time ago,
when the world was young and
full of dough. But John and Susie
are drifting yet, and John is a
busted sport, you bet. They've
drifted thru Henry Blank's golden
pile; they've passed the poverty
line a mile, and Sue is cross and
John is drunk, and both have con
cluded that life is punk. And
Susie thinks as she sees him smoke:
"1 wish that his dad burned head
was broke. He threw a chair at
me yesternight and busted our only
electric light. 1 wash and scrub
and mop the brats while he is
prowling around with the cats.
He's drifting along toward the
county jail; I'll take in washing
and go his bail. For John was al
ways too lazy to row, and I was al
ways too silly to know, and so we
're drifting our whole life thru,
and it's O, for the days of the red
canoe!"-Chas. B. Driscoll, The
Plebian Poet.

There is gloom among the pos
tal clerks and postmasters of Kan
sas, and we presume every place
else. Uncle Sam has ordered a
count of all mail that is handled
during the month of May. This
means lot of extra work at the
postoffice. All in-coming and out
going mail must be classified,
counted and a careful and exact
record kept of the time required to
handle the same. This takes extra
time and if the public will bear
this in mind the postmaster at
Liberal will be grateful. The
count began on the first of the
month and it doesn't get any "fun
nier" as the month wears on.
The Right Spirit
The Hugoton Hermes shows
quite the proper spirit by asking
all the fellows there to get out and
push the proposition for an exten
sion of the auto mail route from
Liberal through Hugoton to Rich
field. It is a certainty that the
Liberal people will line up behind
the proposition, and we believe
that the combination of two good
towns working for an improve
ment will eventually have a good
result We are informed that the
proposed extension would benefit
a number of new mail patrons, be
sides making it possible for pas
sengers to travel from Liberal and
Hugoton to Richfield daily, at a
nominal cost.

Dairying in Dry
Land Farming
Careful farmers in the, dry land
section should make good cows
give and average return ot from
$30, to $50, each per year. Many
do not get more than $12, per year
per cow.
The dry land farmer's supply of
feed is constantly limited by the
sparse fall of rain, and for this
reason he needs the diary cow that
will make the most from every
pound of feed he can give her.
The selection of the cow is of first
concern.
The largest returns are secured
from cows of the extreme dairy
type and of the Holstein-Guernsey
and Jersey and Milking Shorthorn
breeds. The unprofitable diary
cows are those that convert most
of their feed into flesh and yield a
good quantity, of milk for a few
months only. Many dry land
farmers do not have the money
to buy pure-bred diary cows with
and cannot give them the neces
sary care, shelter and feed. Gen
erally the dry land farmer had
better secure his cows from neigh
boring herds of beef cattle, select
ing the cows with diary form that
are usualy found in beef herds.
In selecting range cows for diary
herds there are three essential
points:
First: Great stomach capacity.
The dry land farmer can feed little
grain and Jiis cows must daily eat
large quantities of grass, or rough
age to be profitable. This requires
ample room for storage, and to
secure it the cow must be deep
from back to belly, in front of the
hit) bones and broad in the same
region. Avoid a round bellied cow
whose ribs are short, and a Hat rib
bed cow. The ribs should be long
and well sprung providing for a
large paunch.
Second : The cow's back should
be sharp and have little flesh when
she is in good condition. When
the feed is used to put thick flesh
on the back, as in the case with
beef cattle, it cannot go to produce
milk in the udder. The neck, shoul
ders, rump and thighs should be
thin-fleshed in the well fed animal
Third: Ample room for the ud
der and capacious udder when the
cow is fresh. The cow should be
well cut up behind, between the
legs, so that the udder can extend
well up towards the root of the
tail. The flank should be well
arched instead of level, as in the
beef cow, giving room for the ud
der and the udder should extend
well forward and not hang down.
The milk veins should be large
and the farther they extend for
ward the better. It is essential
that the milk wells, the openings
through which the milk veins pass
into the abdomen, should be large:
as large as the end of one's middle
finger.
The cow needs in the winter a
warm, dry shelter, free from draft.
This can be made of straw or of
sod walls, and straw, or sod roofs,
if lumber cannot be afforded.
Bales of straw will last for years,
when used for stable walls, if the
top of the walls are protected from
rain. The cows in summer should
have a protection from the sun.
This should be placed on the high
est point in the pasture and can be
made by setting up posts and over
them a straw roof so high that the
cows can't eat it. Such a shelter
will furnish shade and will be cool
when the wind blows through it.

Big Fire ki Kinsley
The peoples store at Kinsley
burned last week with a loss of
$38,000. That isnt a patch to
what will happen right here in
Liberal one of these days, when a
fire gets a start in the business
section of the town. There are
but mighty few men on the street
who are not in favor of bonds for
a better water worts system, or at
least one that will afford some
protection for the business part of
town. It isn't a very good policy,
either, to wait until the horse is
stolen before you lock the stable
door. This water proposition
should be taken up now.
For Young Chickens
At this time of year young
chickens are worth nearly twice
as much as hens. The incubator
makes it a comparatively easy
matter to hatch the chickens, but a
is not so easy to raise them. Young
chickens should not be forced too
rapidly for growth and size unless
they are intended for broilers.
Forced growing causes a weakness
that is hard to overcome later on.
A good natural growth is better,
and only such foods as will do this
should be fed. Too heavy feeding
of beef scraps will injure chickens,
and too much heavy grain will re
tard their progress rather than
help them. Do not permit your
chicks to staud on hard boards.
They should be placed where they
will have a chance to scratch in the
dirt. Clean quarters are essential
to the health of the young chicks,
and to obtain the top of the mark
et, the broilers must have made a
growth in from ten to twelve
weeks. Just now the local market
is paying from 35 to 40 cents
each for broilers, depending on
on their condition, which is the
equivalent of 20 cents a pound as
compared with the present price
of 8 cents a pound for hens.
Russel Springs, county seat of
Logan county, will soon hold a-
nother election to vote $15,000
bonds, for the Garden City, Gulf,
& Northern Railway. That town
defeated a proposition last month
for $18,000 bonds and will now
make an effort to vote a smaller
bond issue. Grading work is
progressing rapidly on the north
end of the line.
One of the most important
features affecting the general bus
iness of this town or any other for
that matter, is the matter of good
roads leading into town, and of
good roads in the town. We ought
to be taking some steps towards
oiling the streets of the town here.
If we only make it a block at a
time it will help, and every busi
ness man in town ought to be talk
ing it. We have no Commercial
Club and every man in town should
consider himself as a club of one
to get the spirit and boost.

A Winning
Game
By Harold Strong Latham
(Copyright, 1911, by AiBQCiated Literary
rreaa.j
The silence was unbroken save for
the crackling of the logs in the open
fireplace; the flares threw fascina
ting lights and shadows upon the
faces of those who were sitting be
fore the shrine pondering upon the
mysteries of the fire and other
things.
In the late fall and winter Molly's
hearth was the favorite meeting
place of more than one couple, who,
though nothing had been said, were,
as the neighbors would say, "going
together." That nothing had been
said to Molly, the little circle of
friends were certain, though of lata
they hod noted and discussed Ralph
Osborne's persistent attention to her
and Molly's evident pleasure in it.
"Let's play rigmarole. It's jolly
fun," Molly suggested when she be
gan to feel that though watching
wood burn was all very well for a
time, her guests might like to do
something more exciting.
"What's rigmarole?" big Tom
Carrol, from next door, put in.
"It's a game," Molly replied ab
sently and then caught herself ab
ruptly. "Of course you knew that.
How stupid I Let's see, there are six
of us, that's fine! Well, one of us
starts a story makes it up, you
know and when it gets to the most
exciting or mysterious part stops
and passes it on to the next one,
who must work out the situation as
best he can and lead up to a new
one and pass that one. So it goes.
Do you all see ?"
"Yes," came a chorus of replies.
"Ralph shall start," Molly went
on, and it 11 go to you and you and
you," indicating each of the separate
victims, "and finally come to me.
Then Ralph must finish. The be
ginner always ends the tale," she
said.
Again there was silence, while
Hulph collected his thoughts.
"Well, here goes," he began, after
a time. "My story, like all stories,
begins with a 'once upon a time.'
Once upon a time there were a man
and a maid. His name was was
'Peter, and hers was Sue. Now,
Peter loved Sue, but like the Peter
of the nursery rhyme, he was afraid
he 'couldn't keep her.' For Sue had
everything a fine home, automo
biles, carriages, maids whereas
Peter had only a pumpkin shell 1
Peter was not lazy, or shiftless, or
stupid, but he'd reached only the
pumpkin shell period.
"One day Peter, who could really
stand it no longer, resolved that he
would place his offerings at Sue's
feet and learn his1 fate. He rang the
bell that evening at her door, was
admitted by the. ceremonious butler
and finally ushered into the library,
where he found Mo Sue. They sat
down before a blazing log fire, much
like this one, and after they had
talked of this thing and that, Peter
told her of his love and asked her
the one all-important question. But
unfortunately just aa he finished
speaking, and before Sue could pos
sibly reply, her mother came into the
room and said "
"There," Ralph declared. "I'm
finished. Qo on." He looked cau
tiously up at Molly, but her head
was turned away. No one, not even
he, had noticed the startled expres
sion on her face or her alert atti
tude. "Sue's mother came in," the next
victim continued, "and said that
there was a man outside who insist
ed on seeing Peter at once. Peter
was very angry, but of course he
couldn't show it before the woman
whose daughter he hoped to marry.
Consequently he hurried out and
found the owner of his 'pumpkin
shell,' who told him that unless he
paid the rent that night he was go
ing to dispossess him. Now Peter
sometimes had money, but this eve
ning he had none. So he got his
hat and coat and went with the man,
never saying a word to Sue, who, of
course, was much surprised at his
abrupt exit.
"After thinking it over Peter
finally decided that he would bor
row some money from Frank Cham
bers, one of his friends. According
ly, with the landlord in tow, he
ought Frank's home. When no one
answered his knock he tried the
door. Finding that it was not looked
he opened it. And the strangest
sight met his eyes. In the center of
the room he saw "
"Ha, ha 1" the narrator laughed
gleefully. "What did ho see?"
nudging his neighbor.
"He saw he saw a white ele
phant. Standing supremely alone in
the room which had formerly been oc
cupied by his comrade was this rare
beast of the jungle. In open
mouthed astonishment Peter gazed
at the animal, and then, turning,
fled from the building, the landlord
in hot pursuit. In his haste Peter
had neglected to shut the door and
the white elephant was following
him, too. Up hill and down they
ran, this curious procession, until
they found themselves approaching
the zoo. As they came up to it, Peter
noticed that they were creating wild
excitement among the attendants,
who rushed forth in great numbers
with the director at their head. As
he came up to the panting Peter, he
exclaimed:
" 'Oh, I simply can't take it,' ex
postulated the next person. 'It's
absolutely out of the question. How
do I know what he said ?'
" 'Let me go on,' the fifth one put
in eagerly. He said, 'Where did you
got that white elephant?' 'Found
him,' Peter replied.
"The director looked at him in
amazement, and cn took him by
the shoulders and led him off. All
night they kept Peter and the land
lord there, giving them two little
sleeping rooms in one of the build
ings. Early the next day they were
brought into a large assembly room
where they found many men gath
ered together. They put Peter on a
platform' and the director went to
the front of it and said :
"Go on, Molly. It's up to you
now."
Molly sat bolt upright. "Well,"
she declared, "I must say you've got
me into a pretty mess. Let me
think."
"And said," she went on, after a
minute, " 'Gentlemen, as you all
know, the prize of the zoo, the only
living white elephant in captivity,
has been missing for ten days.
Through the extreme diligence,
bravery and, I may say skill, of this
gentleman,' indicating Peter, 'the
elephant once more adorns our zoo.
I have called this special meeting to
present to Mr. Peter Pumpkin the
reward of $10,000 offered for his re
turn.' "Before Peter could realize what
had happened the money was pressed
into his hands. As soon as he could,
he got away from the grateful crowd,
paid the landlord, even buying from
him the 'pumpkin shell,' and hurried
back to Sue, whom he found much
upset by his disappearance. When
he had explained it all to her, how
ever, she forgave him, and and
and when he repeated his all-important
question she accepted him and
and that's all I know."
Molly looked up in confusion, to
find empty chairs. One by one, un
noticed by her, her friends had
gone, with the conscious feeling that
they were intruding and overhearing
something not meant for them. That
is, they had all gone but Ralph.
Molly looked at him reproach
fully. "How dared you?" she asked.
"It succeeded," he answered, com
ing over to her, "and I simply
couldn't wait."
"You've got to finish the story.
That's the rule of the game. The
beginner alwavs finishes."
"May I ?" he asked.

good melons to the acre, some be
ing two feet long and some being
only 12 inches, but they were all
good, sweet, tough mellons', solid
all the way through. Those mel
lons belong to the pie-citron fam
ily, only much sweeter as they
had been crossed somewhat with a
yellow sweet water melon. They
are a creamy white inside and
solid through and through like
a citron, not juicy as a water
melon, and keep far better than
sweet apples. On Jan. 1, 1910, I
purchased a razor back sow. On
March 1, following, she had eight
pigs, and on September 1, follow
ing, she had seven more pigs. Id
December, 1910, 1 sold ten of the
pigs for $100, having sow and five
pigs left, worth $G6, or a total val
ue of $176 for the sow and all the
pigs. The sow cost me $8, and
the plowing and planting of the
acre of melons $3, or a total of $11
giving a net profit on one acre of
hog melons of $165.
The mother and these pigs were
fed on hog melons only, except
from January until melons came
in, and the feed used during that
time was paid for out of this melon
patch. If I had known how to care
for the melons, I could have had
melons all winter. I have since
learned that if I had put the mel
ons in a pit and covered them with
hay or straw and then with dirt,
they would have kept until the
next May, furnishing plenty of
green feed for my hogs and hor
ses. As it was, I let hundreds
freeze and rot, but this year I will
take better care of them. Now,
you homesteaders in western Kan
sas and Oklahoma, where we have
but little rain, try an acre of these
hog melons and one or two sows;
it beats wheat, corn and broom
corn. Have a five acre patch of
inilo maize, if you wish, to finish
the hogs, but I sold mine off the
melon patch. If you have a larger
and a better hog, so' much the bet
ter. These hog melons will grow
anvwhere. I had a neighbor who
had a small patch planted on white
gyp land and they grew and throve
finely there, growing to a length
of 12 to 18 inches. He has been
feeding nothing but these melons
to his hogs and they are doing
nicely.

"There's so much good in the worst
of us, and there's so much bad in the
best of us, that it doesn't behoove any
of us to speak 111 of the rest of us.'
Attorney General Dawson has
devoted the week to a performance
before the grandstand. He closed
the Sunday theaters because it is
against the law for them to run.
But he let the ball players alone,
probably because it would be very
unpopular to stop them. At least
that is the only conclusion that the
the causal observer is able to draw.
If Dawson, instead of "stalling"
around about the law and "his
duty," had said "I am closing the
theatres because I dont believe in
Sunday performances and the law
gives me the authority to stop
them," nobody would have cared a
great deal. But, although he tried
to confuse the issue, the fact re
mains that the law that closes the
Sunday theatre is equally as effect
ive against base ball. It is the
statute which forbids any kind of
labor on Sunday, and the supreme
court, handed down a decision a
year or two ago to the effect that
the taking of tickets or any form
of service for which money was
paid constituted labor and was in
violation of this statute. The
operation of a street car is a viola
tion of this statute and so is the
production of a Sunday newspaper.
Cigar stores, shine parlors and
soda fountains habitually violate
this law. The decision of the sup
reme court on which Dawson
gives baseball a clean bill has noth
ing to do with this case. It was
made on an appeal from Johnson
county. Two amatuer teams were
playing one Sunday in a cow pas
ture. The local authorities arrest
ed thorn. The Supreme court de
cided when the case came up to it,
that the Johnson county case was
not a violation of the gaming stat
ute, which is an entirely different
proposition from the Sunday labor
law. Had Dawson given a frank
statement for his reason for clos
ing the Sunday theatres there
could have been no reasonable ob
jection, since the law in the matter
is perfectly clear. As it is he
must rest under the suspicion of
having been rather conspicious in
front of the grand stand.
Following the Crawford county
incident.Gov. Stubbs issued his
regular monthly pronunciamen
to to the effect that the governor
would make Kansas dry as a bone
or bust a hamestring. Still you
can't fairly criticize the governor
for repeating himself. Prohibiti
on is the only clarion note he has
left. With the senatorial race
only a year off, he has no other
issue on which to make it. One
by one the props have been kick
ed from under him. Thestandpat
senators cut in on his public utilit
ies issue, and framed and passed a
law in the making of which he had
no hand. Bill White, wet nurse
of the recall and of the initiative
and referendum, was "gigged" on
the recall and is willing to trade
the initative and referendum for
the votes of the regulars. The
governor's hostility to Taft is no
longer popular, and is out of the
question as a campaign issue. His
own people in congress are divided
on reciprocity, as are the voters
at home. So there is no issue for
him there. Prohibition is the
only tosin the governor has left
and he is fairly entitled to all he
can get out of it.
Buy those town lots now and re
alize a nice profit on them. They
will all be gone in a short time.

Poultry On Dry Farms.
Every dry land farmer should
keep from 100 to 400 laying hens.
The hens should be cared for by
the farmer and not by his over
worked wife. They should be fed
and cared for three times a day,
comfortably sheltered, kept free
from vermin and the house cleaned
every day. If the dry land far
mer will make a business of poul
try they can be made to bring him
several hundred dollars each year
whether there is a drouth or not.
The most money is in eggs from
a special egg producing breed and
strain. Egg laying strains of
general purpose breeds come next
in order for profits. Experts es
timate that the average flock pro
duces an average of CO eggs . per
hen, each year, and that where
the poorer half of such Hock is
culled out the average will rise to
120 eggs per hen per year. Cul
ling is particularly important to
the new dry land settler, as he
needs to make every ounce of feed
return a profit and he cannot af
ford to feed unprofitable poultry
In the average flock there are
old hens that lay none or tew eggs
roosters that are not needed, and,
usually, late hatched or stunted
pullets that lay little and eat much.
These culls usually make up half
or more of the flock.
Duiing a considerable part of
the year hens on the farm will
pick up enough waste feed to sup
ply them, but they should be
watched every day and fed when
ever the waste supply is short.
Wheat or milo should form half
the ration for the hens and the
other half can be a mixture of bar
ley, corn and oats.
When hens do not get all the
worms and insects they want they
must be fed meat. Meat meal is
the cheapest form form in which
meat for poultry can be bought.
Often rabbits are trapped and fed
cooked. Hens need meat in some
form daily, but in moderate quan
tities. It is a common custom to
throw the offal at butchering time
where the hens can get it and let
them feed on the carcasses of dead
cattle. Almost always in these
cases hens will over eat sufficien
tly to reduce their egg yield, and
if they have not had meat for
sometime will gorge themselves to
such an extent as never again to
be profitable. This meat is likely
to taint the eggs and the flesh.
Skimmed milk and curds will take
the place of meat.
Poultry should have all the clean
pure water they can drink at least
three times a day. The general
cause for well fed hens not laying
is lack of water. Sixty-five per
cent of the egg and fifteen per
cent of the hen's body is water,
and to lay she must have all she
wants, whenever sho wants it, and
a full supply is neccessary in di
gesting the teed. The chill should
be taken off in the winter and the
hens watched to see that three
times a day they will get all they
will drink before it becomes froz
en. The hen needs some kind of
succulent feed every day: grass,
alfalfa leaves, roots, potatoes, cab
bage, sprouted grain or even green
sorghum. It pays to warm grain
in wintor.
The hens on treeless plains need
cool shade in the summer. Sun
flowers, trees or low straw sheds.
open on all sides, will supply this.
In the Wake of the Measles
The little son of Mrs. O. B.
Palmer, Little Rock, Ark., had
the measles. The result was a
severe cough which grew worse
and hd could not sleep. She says:
"One bottle of Foley's Honey and
Tar compound completely cured
him and he has never been both
ed since." Croup, whooping
cough, measles cough aH yield to
Foley's Honey and Tar Compound.

body had turned in and the lights
were low, a loud voice called from
an upper berth: 'Porter, got a
corkscrew?' The porter came hur
rying down the aisle. Boss,' he
said in a scandalized tone, 'we
don't allow no drinkin' in the
berths. It's against the rules.' 'O
it ain't that, porter' the voice an
swered, 'I just want to dig out a
pillow that's sort o' worked its
way into my ear.' "

GOOD SEED CORN IS VERY SCARCE IN THE
WESTERN PART OF KANSAS THIS YEAR
Very Little Corn of Good Quality was Produced Last Year Because of
the Unfavorable Season Acclimated Varieties Give Best
i Results and Eastern Grown-Seed Should
be Avoided if Possible,
Hy Prof. W. M. Jardlne of K. S. A. C
THE season of 1910 was an (in
duction of corn In the western
favorable one for the pro
half of the state, consequently Very
little corn of good quality was pro
duced. As a result, good seed corn
Is scarce and greatly In demand, while
many farmers were able to secure
sufficient seed for their own planting,
the great majority of them do not
have good seed for sale, or do not
make a practice of trying to save any
more than they themselves will use.
Therefore, it will be necessary for
many protective coin growers to ob
tain seed from sources other than in
their immediate locality. As the short
age of the corn crop was almost unl-
advisable to get seed in the locality
In which the corn is to be grown, pro
viding satisfactory varieties can.be se
cured. Failing in this, the next best
thing to do is to obtain seed from the
nearest locality that has a similar soil
and climatic conditions. Seed that has
been grown a considerable distance to
the east of any given locality Bhould
be avoided If good seed, grown In
about the same longitude or farther
west, is available.
Results of the variety testing at the
Fort Hays Exiveriment Station indi
cate that corn obtained from a sec
tion lying northeasterly from the sta
tion has given better results than seed
secured In localities an equal distance

?.v' - .
Box, on Rear End of Wagon. Put Into It Best Ears and Keep Them for Seed
to .Improve Variety,
versa! over the western portion of the
State It may be rather difficult to
obtain western grown Beed. This con
dition of affairs will likely lead to
many farmers obtaining eastern grown
corn to plant, In which case they will
likely to be badly disappointed, espe
cially if the coming season la not an
exceptionally favorable one for this
cereal.
For best results in the production
of corn in this portion of the State,
especially during an average or dry
Beason, an early or medium early
maturing western grown variety that
Id well ndapted or acclimated should
be grown. Eastern grown corn is not
adapted or acclimated to the condi
tions that usually prevail In tills por
tion of the State.
That better results can be obtained
by growing the beBt varieties of native
corn in preference to those obtained
from a considerable distance to the
east of the locality in which It Is to
be grown. Eastern grown corn la not
cls'vely by extensive variety tests
conducted at the Western Kansas
Experiment Station. During the sea
son of 1909, 45 varieties were ob
tained from all parts of Kansaa, west
ern Nebraska and eastern Colorado
and grown In variety test, wherever
It was posssible only the best produc
ing varieties were secured from the
various localities. While the season
was an unfavorable one for corn, con
ditions were such that the relative
drouth resistance of the numerous
varieties could be readily detected.
Seven of the standard eastern grown
varieties, Iowa Silvermlno, Hoone
County White, Hammett White Dent,
Kansas Sunflower, Hlldreth, Learning,
and Hogues Yellow Dent, yielded at
an average rate of fourteen bushels
per acre, while seven of the best pro
ducing native western grown varieties
produced at an average Tate of twenty
seven and a half bushels per acre; a
difference In yield of nearly 100 per
cent In favor of the western grown
or acclimated varieties.
Another very good illustration of
the value of planting seed of accli
mated varieties can be obtained from
the following
to the east; probably due to the fait
that corn further north matures ear
lier because of the comparatively
shorter Beason; and for this reason
Is better adapted for growing In this
locality than are the later, eastern
varieties. This same principle will
naturally apply to any given locality.
In case It is necessary to plant eastern
grown seed, early maturing varieties
are preferable and the late large
growing corns should be avoided altogether.
WHEN AND HOW TO SOW ALFALFA
Fall
Sowing in Eastern Half of State
and Spring Sowing in West
ern Half is Best.
Do you know when and how to sow
alfalfa? If you live In the eastern half
of Kansas you should sow it In the
fall and In the western half you will
have better success with spring sow
ing. In the eastern half of the state, If
the ground that you wish to sow was
in fall wheat the season before and
was well plowed it will not be neces
sary to re-plow. It should be disked
to the depth of three Inches between
the time the wheat was harvested and
the time the alfalfa Is to be sown.
If you do not grow wheat, oats or
barley would be a good crop to grow
Lin the Bprlng and then sow the alfalfa
in the fall. Often this stubble must be
plowed, for as a rule the ground was
prepared with a disk when the spring
crop was sown.
Care must be taken not to plow the
grqund more than three inches so It
may settle and form a firm seed bed
before the time to seed the alfalfa.
Often It wll be necessary, If there has
been a light rainfall to pack it with a
harrow set straight on a sub-surface
packer. This firm seed bed Is essen
tial in average season to germinate
the seed.
The seeding should be done between
August 15 and September 15. You
should be governed by the season but
if the ground is clean and is in proper
condition the seed -should be sown as

It would be unfair to tell tha
h name of the author of this story ; but
it is too good to pass up.
In Tennessee not many years ago
it was a sport and a science in some
sections to stuff the ballot boxes so
that, no matter how the people voted,
the machine candidates won. In one
little town an enthusiast for honest
government was named as one of the
board of three election judges. His
two companions were ready to slip
into the ballot box enough votes to
elect their man; but they could not
get the honest judge to leave the
voting booth long enough for them
to turn the trick. Finally, after he
had refused to leave long enough for
lunch, all three went to a neighbor
ing hotel for a hasty meal.
The honest judge, who was also
very devout, put the ballot box on
the floor between his feet and, shut
ting his eyes, bowed his head for sev
eral minutes while he asked the
blessing on the meal.
While he was doing this the other
two stuffed the box, and the machine
candidates had a staggering ma
jority. And to this day the honest
judge advertises the fact that for
once he made the election judges
give the people of his town an honeat
deal.

Governor Stubbs last week ad
dressed letters toChancellorSbrong
of the University of Kansas, and
other heads of the state education
al institutions, asking for a report
on the number of hours per day
rooms are in use in the state
schools of higher education in Kan
sas. The data compiled by the
Chancellor in reply shows that re
citation rooms at the University of
Kansas are used on an average 7.2
hours per day, nearly twice as
much as the average for the Unit
ed States. The reports from the
State Normal and Agricultural
School show about the same aver
age of use. The attendance at the
state schools of higher education
has greatly increased within recent
years and a crowded condition of
the buildings has resulted, which
the erection of additional buildings
has only partially relieved.

THE WEAK POIffl
About most wheel implements is the oiling device?
This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boxes"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call him, who
has been with the John Deere Plow Co,, for
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a DuBt Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then fill it and keep it so full of good hard
oil that bust and sand can't get in."
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box.
Deere Wheel tools have screw caps at the outer
ends of the boxes, and flanged collars at the
inner ends. This wheel is found on Cultivators,
and Gang Plows and Listers. It is a

About most wheel implements is the oiling device?
This is admitted by all implement makers, and
they are all making so-called "Dust Proof Boxes"
to overcome the trouble.
"Old Man Brown" as the boys call him, who
has been with the John Deere Plow Co,, for
twenty-five years says: "The only way to make
a DuBt Proof Box is to make it right in the first
place, then fill it and keep it so full of good hard
oil that bust and sand can't get in."
That was well said. So far, no one has made
a box that will absolutely keep out the dust any
other way, but it may be so well made that it
can be kept oozing over with grease. When
the dust touches this it becomes mud, but can
not work into the box.
Deere Wheel tools have screw caps at the outer

Vaudeville Was Good
The rain Friday night was prob
ably responsible for the small
crowd at the Opera House when
the curtain went up for the first
act of the vaudeville given under
the auspices of the club. The au
dience was delighted with the en

the best attractions the town has
had this season, and was more
greatly appreciated because of the
friends ot the caste who were in
the audience. . Miss Gem Vaughn
deserves great commendation for
the excellent training of the little
tots. The music under the direc

your plans for the future and for next

else if you wish or ask advice on some
matter of interest to you.
Here are some of the letters.
Dear Mrs. Todd:
I sincerely hope I will
this examination and finish the com
mon school branches. I have hoped
to for so long that it will really de
light me to know that I have at last
accnmnlished mv plans, lean nam
ly sleep nor eat thinking of it.
Next year if I possibly can i am go
na to iTicrh School either here or
some place else.
r a
I would like to finish College also
hnt. T ea.n not tell vet whether I can
or not as that is too far ahead.
Sincerely yours
Dear Mrs. Todd:
I thoueht I would write to
you and tell you how I am getting a-
lonir.
I think I have done pretty well in
my examinations this year. If I pass
this examination I will start Into
High School next year. If I am not
in Liberal next winter, I will write
to you and tell you how I am getting
along.
Your friend
Dear Mrs. Todd:
I am taking the county ex
amlnations this spring, so if I pass I
will get a county diploma. Because
my parents are talking of moving
away, and if we do I want something
to help me enter nigh School in the
new place we move to. I am so an
xlous to pass that I have tried my
very best. When I get through High
school I want to be a school teacher
and I am going to study hard so
will be a good one. Do you think
will make a good teacher if I try hard
enough?
Your true friend
Dear Mrs. Todd:
I have been trying to think of
someone for advice as to what to do
after these examinations. I thought
mav be you wonld help a fellow,
I have been thinking of becoming
a professional banker. What do jrou
think of the plan? If you think It
will be a good plan I would like for
you to let me know by return mall.
I will close for this time, hoping to
hear from you by return mall, I re
main as ever,
Your friend .
Dear Mrs. Todd:
I expect to ride to school next
year tf I come and I will ride the
same horse that I did this year and
if 1 pass I will go into High School
next year. Do you think I will win?
Yours truly .
Prof. Elmer French who teaches
near Tyrone made us a pleasant call
Saturday afternoon. School teaching
seems to agree with him. He Is plan
ning to attend the Sweard county Nor
mal in July. We have had several
calls for men teachers for our schools
and we gladly welcome Mr. French.
Mr. Herbert Brown, clerk of Dist.
No. 10, came In and showed us the
petition for a new school house for
District 10. It is signed bv more
than one-third of the voters of the
district. We have sent for the blank
notices for the Bond election and will
send them out to the clerk, Mr.
Brown, as soon as we receive them.
We are glad to see a good school
house replace the little "Soddy" that
has answered the calls of school and
church and entertainments in the
past years. We wish we could divide
the district but valuation is not e
hough to do so according to the new
law which requires a valuation of
$100,000 for a new district. We
wish the new Golden Plains School
House success and rejoice in the har
mony and good sense displayed by all
in the district. Each seems to be
worklne for the best interests of his
neighbor as well as his own.
At a meeping of the Kansas teach
ers association one of the speakers
created a stir by asking a lot of ques
tions the teachers could not answer,
Some of the riddles were: What is a
Babcock test? What if a Tedder?
What is dry farming? We believe
our teachers could answer these ques
tions.
Fridav we visited several of the
grades in company with Misses Hen
line, Kelton, Odneal and Mr. Lawr
ence" we always enioy visiting
school. There Is always something
so original in a groupe of children
either large or small Such an imita
tion of we larger children. In near
ly every room we found boys and
girls who once called us their teacher
and as we looked back through the
vista of years we wondered and hoped
that we had sown some seed that in
cominir vears they would thank us
for. The hill of knowledge is hard
to climb and we teachers should ever
be on the alert to extend the helping
hand at the right time and help the
little feet to find a firm place to stand
on in their efforts to climb higher,
just telling interesting stories and
keeping them amused is not teaching
school, that's just keeping school. It
takes perspiration to teach school
One can keep cool, decidedly so, and
keep school. It takes nerve and
thought and wisdom to discover what
knowledge the child already possesses
in numbers, in reading, in grammar
and then graft and cause to grow that
foundation, the new knowledge, so
that it will grow and blossom and
bring forth fruit and the child will
feel the ecstatic delight of learning
something new, then when that Idea
has taken firm hold, grow out or
cause to grow another idea and so on
until the climbing grows easier and
the child with joy learns that he can
go with less and less help and finally
he can reason and think out things
for himself. Much, yes, practically
everything depends on the teacher.
It is said of John Hopkins that he on
one end of a log and a child on the
other end made a University.
The pupils of the Seward county
High School went on their annual
picnic last Friday, the instructors
accompanying them. There were
about 70 in all and it took two
large' hay racks to accomodate
them. They started from here at
7 o'clock in the morning and drove
to the Forb's grove where the day
was pleasantly spent in various
pastimes. The picnicers were
caught in the rain on the way
home and stopped in at a rural
school house until the storm abat
ed. They reached town about
midnight a little damp but in the
best of spirits.
Warning to Railroad Men
E. S. Bacoon, 11 Bast St., Bath,
Me., send out this warning to
railroaders: "A conductor on the
railroad, my work caused a chronic
inflammation of the kidneys, and
I was miserable and all played out.
A friend advised Foley Kidney
Pills and from the day I com
menced taking them, 1 regain my
strength. The inflammation clear
ed and I am far better than I have
been for twenty years. The weak
ness and dizzy spells are a thing
of thn nast and I highly recom
mend Foley Kidney Pills." For
sale by all druggists.
Liberal School News
The efficiency of a school may
judged by the success of its pupils
when placed in new situation. In
the recent examination for county
diplomas, every one of the Liberal
pupils in the "A" division of the
8th grade who wrote secured a di
ploma. But that isn't all. The
B" division does not finish the
work until next January, yet out
of the five or six who took the ex
amination only one failed to get a
diploma a pretty good proof of
the character of work done by the
Liberal schools.
Mayor Nichols was represented
by his two stalwart sons and love-
y little daughter at primary last

The Yth and 8th grades went to

Enforce the Curfew
The city officers have decided
that the curfew ordinance is
good one and have arranged to
have the whistle at the electric

9 o'clock. After that time, all
children under 18 will be compelled
to leave the streets unless they are
on their way to or from some
place on business or are accom
panied by their pnaents or guard
ians. Marshall Gray has been in
structed to enforce the ordinance

A ROTATION TEST TO LAST FOR 30 YEARS
Will land ever wear out and how
eoon If used for -wheat, corn and al
falfa In continuous culture and rota
tion If no plant food Is used? What
should be planted In certain soils?
Vital questions those and some which
may be solved soon and maybe not
until 1940 for an experiment Is In
progress now at the Kansas State Ag
ricultural ollege which may last for
thirty years or until the secrets of
the ground are discovered.
Sometime In the future, it may not
be for many years, It may take genera
tions, experts at the Kansas City Ag
ricultural College, will have a clue as
to just what certains soils will pro
duce. Experiments, such as those that
have been In progress for a year or
more at the college, have been going
on in England at Rothamsted Station
for Blxty years. They have been con
ducted in Ohio for twenty-five or
thirty years, and in Illinois for nearly
as long; all of which shows how im
portant Is the information the agro
nomist seeks.
On the college farm at Manhattan
are 100 plots one-tenth of an acre in
size. These plots are divided Into
series of twelve. One series will be
planted continually to alfalfa, one in
wheat and one in corn. Three of the
series of twelve plots will be used
for a rotation of corn, cow peas and
wheat In the order named. On four
of the series there will be a sixteen
vfiir rotation of alfalfa, wheat and
corn. Each of these series Is to con
tain twelve plantings fertilized with
different kinds of fertilizers and with
different applications of barnyard
manure. It may therefore be sixteen
years before Leland E. Call, assistant
professor of soils, shall know the out
come of the work he has begun. He
may have a clue in five years and the
secret may not be disclosed until aftei
he and everyone in the catalog have
gained their final reward.
Farmers ot the old school, by
which is meant farmers in the early
years of the college when it was strug
gling for an existence, did not believe
In such experiments. They shlei at
anything scientific and usually ob
jected to engaging in tests in which
the returns were so indefinite. But
now-a-days tue farmer' golden age
the men whose votes elect the legis
lators and the men who sit in the
legislature also, are the first to favor
every experiment that Bhall ultimately
redound to the betterment of agricul
ture and consequently to the human
race. The agronomist must plant year
by year, and watch carefully every
seed and note its conduct. The soils
must be analyzed to determine the
effect upon them of the several crops,
the whole program looking to the in
creased yield of every product upon
which the world depends.
Academy to Move?
It has been announced that the
riends .Academy at Fowler has
not yet engaged teachers on account
of the opening of the new high
school at that place. It seems to
be an indication that that institu
tion will be moved to some other
point. If the Friends should de
cide to bring the Academy here,
we believe it would be but a short
time until they would be able to
secure an endowment large enough
to insure the permanency of the
school at this point.
At the present market price, the
fertilizing elements in corn cobs are
worth less than a dollar a ton. Used
as a fertilizer, it takes a long time to
get nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and
potassium necessary elements into
the soil.
About the only food value corn cobs
have is to divide and lighten corn
meal when fed with It, thus allowing
the penetration of the digestive juices.

some experimental farming. It
seems that the department of ex

had some money left over from its
appropriation, and is arranging
for quite a lot of experimental
farming in the western part of the
state. This is to be carried on by
farmers in several localities, under
the supervision of lhe experimen
tal department of the agricultural
college. M r. Leid igh came here at
the solicitation of Melvin Wheeler
and has placed the matter of se
curing our farmers to do the work
in the hands of John Boles, the
President of the local farmer's

Important action, announce

whereby the section of the Garden
City, Quit & Northern railroad
from here to Scott will pass next
Sunday into the hands of the San
ta Fe, means to Garden City that
the long-looked-for division be
ginning has been made.
Announcement by the Gulf

Saturday in voting down, 132 to
149, less than the necessary two
thirds, the uroposal of l'he Gulf
road that Scott township return to
the road the stock issued for
bonds, conditional upou establish
ment there of a division.
E. A. Tennis for the road, made
this statement to The Telegram to
day: "The management of the Gard
en City, Gulf & Northern Hail
road company announces the
transfer of property from Garden
City to Scott to the Santa Fe
railway system on and after Sun
day May 28, 1911.
"In disposing of this property
to the Santa Fe company, Garden
City has gained an important div
ision of this system and should
accept this announcement with
entire satisfaction, bringing as it
will, increased population, better
facilities for north and northeast
connections, and a closer affiliation
with the city and corporation
which has already done much for
,this locality.. '
" "A new division will be formed
making Garden City the western
terminal, and Greatbend the east
ern terminal. Trains leaving
Greatbend in the morning will re
main here over night, and those
leaving Garden City in the morn
will remain over night in Great
bend. "The neighboring town of Scott
thus suffers to the advantage of
Garden City.
"The extension of the railroad
south from Garden City, by Mr.
McCue and his associates, has been
permanently abandoned, the risk
being too hazardous in view of the
early construction of a line of rail
road through the south counties,
affording them better facilities for
their products than we could hope
to do by a north and south rail
road connection.
"Besides this, our ambition to
reach a desirable gulf connection
would noUbe well served were we
to continue south as contemplated,
through an undeveloped country
removed from irrigation possibili

It Appears That Something
Will Be Done.
A petition signed by a number
of free holders was presented to
the special meeting of the council
last week, and it is generally un
derstood that at the next regular
meeting of the council, the peti
tion asking for a special election
to vote bonds for water works will
be granted. At another meeting
Saturday, Mr. Sutherlin of Suth
ernlin & Co., dealers in bonds at
Kansas City appeared before the
council, and offered to contract to
buy the bonds, in case the election
carried for the proposition. He
offered a bonus of S4U0 for six
per cent bonds, and also agreed to
furnish the legal -advice and pay
all the expenses of the election

money to commence work within
thirty days after the election is

the city officials entered into a

CLEANING FOR PARTICULAR
BIG VALUATION
Assessment of Seward Coun
ty Will Pass Seven Million
Mark This Year
While the tax rolls have not yet
been made up, the reports in the
office of the county clerk are com
plete enough to show that there
will be a great increase in the as
sessed valuation of Seward county
this year. The assessed value of
personal property and real estate
last year was $6,715,263, while
this year the total will reach to
$7,026,881, or an increase of about
$281,618. The complete returns
of the assessed value of personal
property show a nice gain in every
township, with Fargo township
in the lead, with an increase of
$90,190. Liberal city township
follows with an increase of $78,503.
Liberal township has an increase
of $29,510, while Seward town
ship shows an incrcaso of $8,175.
The real estate assessment lias
not yet been completed, but it is
estimated by E. D. Cooper, county
clerk, that about $75,000 worth
of land will be added to the tax
roles this year. The great in
crease of $206,618 in personal
proyerty was unexpected by the
county officers, who had thought
that it would not much exceed
$50,000. The per capita valua
tion is highest in the city of Lib
eral and it has increnscd ab ut
$35 per capita this year. In ev
ery township tho number of tax
payers has decreased, except in
Fargo where 217 will pay taxes
this year, as compared with 196
in 1910. While there will prob
ably be some changes after the
meeting of the board of equaliza
tion, it is not probable that the
total assessment valuation will be
below the 7 million mark.
An increase of 4.2 per cent in
the total valuation of the county
and an increase of 18.6 per cent
in the assessed valuation of per
sonal property, shows the advance
we have made in a year which
was not an especially good one

The Wrong Thing
The old idea that every Amer
ican boy has a good chance of be
coming President has been a source
of harm to American education
and is a fiction that ought to be
discarded right away, according to
Professor Charles Zueblin, of Bos
ton, who lectured at the University
of Kansas last week. "The average
American working man expects
always to remain a working man
and should be prepared for his
calling in the largest sense," says
Professor Zueblin. Industrial
training, he thinks, should be a
required part of every course in
every year of school. Professor
Zueblin would find out at an early
age what the particular bent of
every boy and girl is, and shape
their future training accordingly.
"Let him learn all subjects in rela
tion to the one in which he has
special interest. Then he will get
something he can remember at the
same time he gets mental discip
line. Three kinds of people em
ployers, employes, and the general
public need industrial training,"
says Professor Zueblin.

"The children should know and
remember what their fathers have ac
complished," said a native to a
Frcnchmau as they stood before a
monument which had just been
erected in the East park, at Tokyo.
The monument is probably the only
one of its kind. It is one of the
monster siege guns captured by the
Japanese from the Russians in the
war with that country, and it haa
been erected complete, with every de
tail restored. Writing about the me
morial, the visitor says : "It made
deep impression on me, this grim in
strument of war in the midst of a
peaceful scene; and if the smiling
young people who stood about it saw
as I did, they read in the lines of

injunction: 'Keep your powder

BATTLE OF AGINCOURT.
Agincourt, from which Henry V.
made his triumphal entry into Lon
don, is our English way of spelling
Azincourt, just as Blenheim is a sim

about 2lv hours Henry's little army
slew 10,000 Frenchmen, nearly twice
as many as we ourselves lost out
right in battle during our Boer war,
lasting over 2!2 years and yet we
talk complacently of our "modern
arms of precision!" A monument
at Agincourt marks the cemetery of
the slain. Few battlefields hare
changed their appearance so little.
The field may be reached within a
railway hour from Boulogne, but few
tourists go to the scene of the most
wonderful feat of arms achieved by
our race. London Chronicle.

Santa Fe Will
Build Cutoff
Dodge City-Colmor Line Will
Save Seyehty-One Miles
in Distance.
From The Denver Post.
Las Vegas, N. M. Feb. 20. It
was learned here today from an
authorative source that the Santa
Ferhas begun the purchase of a
right-of-way for fts Dodge Uity
Colmor cutoff. The proposed cut
off will run in. almost an air line
from Dodge City, Kansas, to Col
mor, N. M., and will reduce the
distance now traversed by the
road's main , line between the two
poines seventy-one miles, besides
avoiding the steep' Katon moun
tain grade and tunnel. It will
open up a new territory for the
output of coal mines along the
Santa Fe.
This cutoff likely will be the" first
section of the Santa Fe's new
road shortening improvements to
be built. The second will be the
Sulzbacher-Vaughn cutoff, a dis
tance of 100 miles, which will form
a connecting link in the Santa Fe's
Gal yeston-to-Denver line. Surveys
for both cutoffs were completed
late last fall.

full moon; when he started home
he had only 25 cents and that was
the last quarter. . His mother-in-law
met him at the door with a
rolling pin. and that was a total
eclipse. "

The Surest Dry Land Grain.
Milo is the surest yielding grain
crop that is grown in Eastern Col
orado, Western Kansas and Okla
homa, the Panhandle of Texas and
Eastern New Mexico.
The U, S. Department of Agri
culture reports the average yield
for five years at Amarillo, Texas,
and other dry land experiment
stations at 40 bushels of grain per
acre a year. Farmers in the same
section report yields of from thir
ty to eighty bushels per acre.
A bushel of milo will produce
from ten to. eleven - pounds of
pork. This makes the average an
nual pork production from the dry
lands of the southwest equal to
400 and upwards pounds of pork
per acre where milo is grown and
fed. Ten pounds of milo have the
same feeding value for horses,
beef and dairy cattle, hogs and
sheep as nine pounds of corn.
- Milo is the corn tor the plains
of the Southwest and should be
grown instead of corn where the
annual rainfall drops below twenty-five
inches. Farmers in the
Panhandle of Texas say that it
never fails to yield a crop of grain,
and that it will yield twenty bush
els an acre in years so dry that
wheat is an absolute failure. Milo
should have the same place in dry
land farming that corn has in Iowa
and Illinois. It has nearly the
same composition as corn, like
feeding qualities, and can be used
with protiit for the feeding of ev
ery class of farm animals to which
com is fed.
: Every farmer in this section
this year should plant and thor
oughly cultivate at least 40 acres
of milo. It will insure his pros
perity and the prosperity of the
entire community. Milo, well cul
tivated, is a sure crop and a large
acreage means well fed teams, and
plenty of grain to fatten steers
and hogs and to feed dairy cows.

Warning to Railroad Men.
Look out for severe and even
dangerous' kidney and bladder
trouble resulting from years of
railroading. Geo. E. Bell, of 639
Third St. Fort Wayne, Ind., was
many years a conductor on the
Nickel Plate. He says, "Twenty
years of railroading left my kid
neys in terrible condition. There
was a continual pain across my
back and hips and my kidneys
gave me much distress, and the
action of my bladder was frequent
and most painful. I got a supply
of Foley Kidney Pills and the first
bottle made a wonderful improve
ment, and four bottles cured me
completely. Since being cured I
have recommended Foley Kidney
Pills to many of my railroad
friends.
